10-Year Lunar Architecture Capability Study (LunA-10) |The 10-Year Lunar Architecture (LunA-10) capability study aims to rapidly develop foundational technology concepts that move away from individual scientific efforts within isolated, self-sufficient systems, toward a series of shareable, scalable systems that interoperate &mdash; minimizing lunar footprint and creating monetizable services for future lunar users.|https://www.darpa.mil/JSON/program/ten-year-lunar-architecture-luna-10-capability-study.json|STO|Maj Michael Nayak|/staff/maj-michael-nayak.html|Sensors,Novel Sensing and Detection,/tag-list.html?tag=Sensors;Space,Space Systems,/tag-list.html?tag=Space;Systems,Systems of Systems,/tag-list.html?tag=Systems|It is the year 2035, and a thriving lunar economy exists on the Moon. How did we get there?DARPA supports a future model where the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), international governments, and commercial industry can rapidly scale up lunar exploration and commerce, enabled and supported by the deployment of an efficiently combined, integrated lunar infrastructure framework. An integrated framework would upend the current technical paradigm, whereby each lunar lander or activity must organically support all required resources such as survival power, communications, and data storage.The 10-Year Lunar Architecture (LunA-10) will explore the rapid development of foundational technology concepts designed to move away from individual scientific efforts within isolated, self-sufficient systems and toward a series of shareable, scalable, resource-driven systems that interoperate – minimizing lunar footprint and creating monetizable services for future lunar users.LunA-10 Topic Area 1 (TA-1) focuses on a portfolio of lunar providers and users who will, together, define a series of future integrated lunar frameworks that take advantage of commercial development and nongovernmental funding streams. Each integrated system design and framework will be backed by a quantitative analysis of needs, validated analysis for anticipated use case(s), concepts of operations, scaling analysis for foundational systems, and metrics for integrated system performance. Performers will identify current investments and future technical challenges toward achieving these goals.LunA-10 is grounded in the Outer Space Treaty (1967). In accordance with Article IV of the treaty, all developments and involvement by civilian and/or military personnel in this effort pertain to scientific and peaceful purposes.The envisioned lunar architecture is not intended to support human exploration or scientific experimentation that does not have commercial value. DARPA’s LunA-10 TA-1 effort is focused on creating off-Earth economic vibrancy through monetizable commercial services provided to a wide variety of users intending to operate on and around the Moon.If you have any questions, please reach out to LUNA10@darpa.mil|/news-events/2023-08-15,A Framework for Optimized, Integrated Lunar Infrastructure;/news-events/aerial-dragnet,Aerial Dragnet;/news-events/ouija-ta2-proposers-day,Ouija TA-2  Proposers day;/news-events/ursa-proposers-day,URSA Proposers Day;/news-events/2023-01-23,Liquid-Mirror Program to Revolutionize Telescope Designs

Current approaches to develop molecules for a given application are intuition-driven, mired in slow iterative design/test cycles and ultimately limited by the specific molecular expertise of the chemist, bottlenecks in the synthesis of candidates, and the pace of by-hand validation and optimization of these candidates.DARPA's Accelerated Molecular Discovery (AMD) program is developing new, systematic approaches that increase the pace of discovery and optimization of high-performance molecules. Specifically, performers are developing closed-loop systems that exploit, build and integrate tools for: 1) extracting existing data from databases and text; 2) executing autonomous experimental measurement and optimization; and 3) incorporating computational approaches to develop physics-based representations and predictive tools. AMD systems will provide a comprehensive computational and experimental means to design, discover, validate and optimize new molecules, iteratively and actively learning to more efficiently and effectively discover molecules that enhance performance in applications relevant to national security. |/news-events/accelerated-molecular-discovery.html,Accelerated Molecular Discovery;/news-events/2018-10-04.html,Discovering New Molecules for Military Applications ;/program/make-it.html,Make-It ;/news-events/2018-06-19.html,The Right Chemistry, Fast: Employing AI and Automation to Map Out and Make Molecules;/news-events/knowlege-directed-artificial-intelligence-reasoning-over-schemas-proposers-day.html,Knowledge-directed Artificial Intelligence Reasoning Over Schemas (KAIROS) Proposers Day

The information used in developing this understanding comes from many disparate sources, in a variety of genres, and data types, and as a mixture of structured and unstructured data. Unstructured data can include text or speech in English and a variety of other languages, as well as images, videos, and other sensor information. Even structured sources can vary in the expressiveness, semantics, and specificity of their representations. Moreover, analysis is complicated by the need to overcome the noisy, conflicting, and potentially intentionally deceptive nature of the data.It is a challenge for those who strive to achieve and maintain an understanding of these events, situations, and trends that information from each medium is often analyzed independently, without the context provided by information from other media. Often, each independent analysis results in only one interpretation, with alternatives being eliminated due to lack of evidence, even in the absence of contradictory evidence. When these independent, impoverished analyses are combined, generally late in the analysis process, the result can be a single apparent consensus view that does not reflect a true consensus.The goal of Active Interpretation of Disparate Alternatives (AIDA) is to develop a multihypothesis semantic engine that generates explicit alternative interpretations of events, situations, and trends from a variety of unstructured sources, for use in noisy, conflicting, and potentially deceptive information environments. This engine must be capable of mapping knowledge elements automatically derived from multiple media sources into a common semantic representation, aggregating information derived from those sources, and generating and exploring multiple hypotheses about the events, situations, and trends of interest. This engine must establish confidence measures for the derived knowledge and hypotheses, based on the accuracy of the analysis and the coherence of the semantic representation of each hypothesis. This engine must also be capable of utilizing knowledge in the common semantic representation and the generated hypotheses as alternate contexts for the media analysis algorithms by altering their models or prior probabilities to enhance accuracy and resolve ambiguities in line with expectations from the context. In addition, the engine must be able to communicate with its user to reveal the generated hypotheses and to allow the user to alter the hypotheses or to suggest new ones. |/work-with-us/situational-awareness-for-hadr.html,Situational Awareness for HADR;/program/low-resource-languages-for-emergent-incidents.html,Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents ;/program/broad-operational-language-translation.html,Broad Operational Language Translation ;/program/deep-exploration-and-filtering-of-text.html,Deep Exploration and Filtering of Text ;/news-events/2017-05-31.html,Teaching Robots “Manners”: Digitally Capturing and Conveying Human Norms

To build secure cyber systems, it is necessary to protect not only the computers and networks that make up these systems but their human users as well.We call attacks on humans “social engineering” because they manipulate or “engineer” users into performing desired actions or divulging sensitive information. The most general social engineering attacks simply attempt to get unsuspecting internet users to click on malicious links. More focused attacks attempt to elicit sensitive information, such as passwords or private information from organizations or steal things of value from particular individuals by earning unwarranted trust.These attacks always have an “ask,” a desired behavior that the attacker wants to induce from the victim. To do this, they need trust from the victim, which is typically earned through interaction or co-opted via a spoofed or stolen identity. Depending on the level of sophistication, these attacks will go after individuals, organizations, or wide swathes of the population.Social engineering attacks work because it is difficult for users to verify each and every communication they receive. Moreover, verification requires a level of technical expertise that most users lack. To compound the problem, the number of users that have access to privileged information is often large, creating a commensurately large attack surface.The Active Social Engineering Defense (ASED) program aims to develop the core technology to enable the capability to automatically identify, disrupt, and investigate social engineering attacks. If successful, the ASED technology will do this by actively detecting attacks, intervening in communications between users and potential attackers, and coordinating investigations into the source of the attacks. |/news-events/2022-06-03.html,DARPA’s ANSR to Improving Trustworthy AI;/news-events/2017-08-16.html,DARPA Assured Autonomy Seeks to Guarantee Safety of Learning-enabled Autonomous Systems;/program/assured-neuro-symbolic-learning-and-reasoning.html,Assured Neuro Symbolic Learning and Reasoning;/program/harnessing-autonomy-for-countering-cyberadversary-systems.html,Harnessing Autonomy for Countering Cyberadversary Systems;/staff/mr-daniel-kerr.html,Mr. Daniel R.

It could be used for medical treatments in locales without advanced hospitals, remote detonation of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and mobile imaging or inspection of shipping containers’ contents to counter chem-bio and radiological threats. A deployable LINAC could also enable portable sterilization for foods and surfaces to prevent contamination and infection in deployed environments.The program seeks to develop a compact LINAC that can create electron beams with energy up to 35 mega-electron volts (MeV) in a package that weighs less than 75 kilograms and can fit in a 1-meter long cylinder with 0.4-meter diameter.  The LINAC will need to be ruggedized so that it can be transported by air, rail, or truck and operate in widely varying heat or cold conditions. |/news-events/advanced-concept-compact-electron-linear-accelerator-proposers-day.html,Advanced Concept Compact Electron Linear-accelerator (ACCEL) Proposers Day;/news-events/2021-01-08.html,DARPA Seeks Compact, Deployable Electron Accelerator;/news-events/2014-09-16.html,Lightweight, Soft Exosuit Aims to Prevent Musculoskeletal Injury in Warfighters;/news-events/2013-08-22.html,Warrior Web Closer to Making Its Performance-Improving Suit a Reality;/news-events/2013-05-22.html,Warrior Web Prototype Takes Its First Steps

This gap in capability means that any air-breathing hypersonic vehicles developed today would use disposable rockets for one-time boosts up to operating speed, limiting the vehicles’ usefulness. To help remove these constraints and lay the framework for routine hypersonic flight with reusable vehicles, DARPA has launched its Advanced Full Range Engine (AFRE) program. AFRE seeks to develop and demonstrate a new aircraft propulsion system that could operate over the full range of speeds required from low-speed takeoff through hypersonic flight. AFRE aims to explore a turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) engine concept, which would use a turbine engine for low-speed operations and a dual-mode ramjet – which would work efficiently whether the air flowing through it is subsonic (as in a ramjet) or supersonic (as in a scramjet) – for high-speed operations. The AFRE program will initially conduct system design, sub- and large-scale component development, and ground demonstration, and will culminate with a large-scale, integrated test series or a propulsion wind tunnel free-jet test of the integrated low- and high-speed flowpaths. |/news-events/advanced-full-range-engine.html,Advanced Full Range Engine;/news-events/proposers-day-announcement-for-ace.html,Air Combat Evolution (ACE) Proposers Day;/news-events/air-combat-evolution-technical-area-one-proposers-day.html,Air Combat Evolution (ACE) Technical Area 1 Proposers Day;/news-events/air-space-total-awareness-for-rapid-tactical-execution-proposers-day.html,Air Space Total Awareness for Rapid Tactical Execution (ASTARTE) Proposers Day;/news-events/control-of-revolutionary-aircraft-with-novel-effecters-proposers-day.html,Control of Revolutionary Aircraft with Novel Effecters (CRANE) Proposers Day

DARPA’s technical vision for APT is to harness plants’ innate mechanisms for sensing and responding to environmental stimuli, extend that sensitivity to a range of signals of interest, and engineer discreet response mechanisms that can be remotely monitored using existing ground-, air-, or space-based hardware. To succeed, APT must ensure that modified plants are safe, robust, and self-sustaining in their environments. The program hinges on the advancement of technologies for performing multiple, complex modulations to plants, without sacrificing their environmental fitness. Although APT pursues technology for eventual deployment, the initial research is conducted entirely in contained facilities. If the research is successful, later-phase field trials would take place under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service following all standard protocols for plant biosafety.   |/news-events/advanced-plant-technologies-proposers-day,Advanced Plant Technologies Proposers Day;/news-events/2017-11-17,Nature’s Silent Sentinels Could Help Detect Security Threats ;https://sam.gov/opp/597bf60984314db1b3ecfce393677c75/view,Biological Technologies;/news-events/breakthrough-biological-technologies-for-national-security,Breakthrough Biological Technologies for National Security;/news-events/insect-allies-proposers-day,Insect Allies Proposers Day

The specific goals of this effort are to: Explore the use of third wave AI methods to enhance models of complex interconnected processes. In particular, to develop hybrid AI models of the climate and Earth system that capture missing physical, chemical, or biological processes with sufficient computational efficiency to explore decadal scale effects and characterize tipping points and bifurcations.Develop methods to assimilate diverse data into models and estimate the “value of new data” to enhance confidence in target-specific forecasts relative to state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques.Climate change, whether natural or human-driven, has huge potential impacts on geopolitical and economic stability, food and water security, and DoD missions and operations. Current climate models of highly complex, underlying physical processes are computationally intensive and provide limited actionable guidance to policy makers, especially on the risks and causes of sudden tipping-points, runaway feedback loops, and the strategic implications of potential adversarial activity. Third wave AI methods (e.g., neuro-symbolic hybrid AI models that can incorporate context and can extract causal factors and internal structure) have the potential to improve the accuracy of climate forecasts as well as improve the predictability of tipping points and to provide actionable guidance on new data when predictability remains poor. Faster learned models, particularly when used in conjunction with full-scale physics models for validation, will enable policy makers to better explore the climate impacts and risks of policy decisions. Quantifying climate risks is essential to prepare for a range of scenarios such as those related to DoD planning and decision support (e.g., arctic strategy/defense, regional destabilization, global power/economic realignment, base/force locations, and extreme weather threats) and to identify new potential high-value observations (e.g., stratospheric vs. ocean surface vs. deep ocean vs. arctic, etc.) to enhance confidence in forecasts. The 18-month AIE program will develop hybrid AI methods in Phase 1 (12-months) using open and rich datasets; and in Phase 2 (6 months), the program will apply the developed methods to quantify the “value of new data” for target-specific forecasts and establish the benefits of new methods relative to SOTA.|/news-events/knowledge-management-at-scale-and-speed-proposers-day,Knowledge Management at Scale and Speed (KMASS) Proposers Day;/news-events/perceptually-enabled-task-guidance-proposers-day,Perceptually-enabled Task Guidance (PTG) Proposers Day;/news-events/2023-01-25,VIDEO: A New Generation of AI Assistants  ;/news-events/2022-03-14,Voices from DARPA Podcast Episode 54: Climate Tipping Points;/news-events/2021-06-21,Ensuring Continuity of Knowledge During Unit Rotations, Individual Replacements

Finally, the program will scale the tactical application of autonomous dogfighting to more complex, heterogeneous, multi-aircraft, operational-level simulated scenarios informed by live data, laying the groundwork for future live, campaign-level Mosaic Warfare experimentation.In a future air domain contested by adversaries, a single human pilot can increase lethality by effectively orchestrating multiple autonomous unmanned platforms from within a manned aircraft. This shifts the human role from single platform operator to mission commander. In particular, ACE aims to deliver a capability that enables a pilot to attend to a broader, more global air command mission while their aircraft and teamed unmanned systems are engaged in individual tactics. ACE creates a hierarchical framework for autonomy in which higher-level cognitive functions (e.g., developing an overall engagement strategy, selecting and prioritizing targets, determining best weapon or effect, etc.) may be performed by a human, while lower-level functions  (i.e., details of aircraft maneuver and engagement tactics) is left to the autonomous system. In order for this to be possible, the pilot must be able to trust the autonomy to conduct complex combat behaviors in scenarios such as the within visual range dogfight before progressing to beyond visual range engagements.The ACE demonstrations will bridge the gap from simple physics-based automated systems currently in use to complex systems capable of effective autonomy within highly dynamic and uncertain environments at mission speeds. The technology development on the ACE program addresses four primary challenges: Increase air combat autonomy performance in local behaviors (individual aircraft and team tactical) Build and calibrate trust in air combat local behaviors  Scale performance and trust to global behaviors (heterogeneous multi-aircraft) Build infrastructure for full-scale air combat experimentation |/news-events/proposers-day-announcement-for-ace.html,Air Combat Evolution (ACE) Proposers Day;/news-events/2023-02-13.html,ACE Program’s AI Agents Transition from Simulation to Live Flight ;/news-events/2021-03-18a.html,Collaborative Air Combat Autonomy Program Makes Strides;/news-events/2020-11-11.html,DARPA Selects Teams to Further Advance Dogfighting Algorithms;/news-events/2019-05-08.html,Training AI to Win a Dogfight

Yet operators of even the most automated aircraft must still manage dauntingly complex interfaces and be prepared to respond effectively in emergencies and other unexpected situations that no amount of training can fully prepare one for. Avionics and software upgrades can help, but the high cost of such improvements—which can run into the tens of millions of dollars per aircraft—has limited the development, testing and fielding of novel automation capabilities.   To help overcome these challenges, DARPA created the Aircrew Labor In-Cockpit Automation System (ALIAS) program. ALIAS envisions a tailorable, drop-in, removable kit that would promote the addition of high levels of automation into existing aircraft, enabling operation with reduced onboard crew. The program intends to leverage the considerable advances made in aircraft automation systems over the past 50 years, as well as similar advances in remotely piloted aircraft automation, to help reduce pilot workload, augment mission performance and improve aircraft safety. As an automation system, ALIAS aims to support execution of an entire mission from takeoff to landing, even in the face of contingency events such as aircraft system failures. ALIAS system attributes, such as persistent-state monitoring and rapid recall of flight procedures, would further enhance flight safety. Easy-to-use touch and voice interfaces would facilitate supervisor-ALIAS interaction. ALIAS would also provide a platform for integrating additional automation or autonomy capabilities tailored for specific missions.|/news-events/2016-12-23.html,ALIAS Pushes the Envelope on Aircraft Automation;/news-events/2014-04-18.html,ALIAS Seeks to Provide Portable, Flexible Advanced Autopilot Capabilities;/news-events/darpa-subterranean-challenge-final-event.html,DARPA Subterranean Challenge Final Event;/news-events/offset-proposers-day.html,OFFSET Proposers Day;/news-events/subt-challenge-proposers-day.html,SubT Challenge Proposers Day

When the environment contains other people, humans use a skill called theory of mind (ToM) to infer their mental states from observed actions and context, and predict future actions from those inferred states. When humans form teams, these models can become extremely complex. High-performing teams naturally align key aspects of their models to create shared mental models of their environment, equipment, team, and strategies. ToM and the ability to create shared mental models are key elements of human social intelligence. Together, these two skills form the basis for human collaboration at all scales, whether the setting is a playing field or a military mission.Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have made little progress in understanding the most important component of the environments in which they operate: humans. This lack of understanding stymies efforts to create safe, efficient, and productive human-machine teams. The Artificial Social Intelligence for Successful Teams (ASIST) program seeks to develop foundational AI theory and systems that demonstrate the basic machine social skills needed to infer the goals and situational knowledge of human partners, predict what they will need, and offer context-aware actions in order to perform as adaptable and resilient AI teammates. ASIST performers will work to create agents that demonstrate a machine ToM and the ability to participate in an effective team by representing and helping to maintain shared models. The program seeks to create and employ a testbed for evaluating these agents using customizable open-world environments and standardized interfaces. The interfaces will include a package of standard sensing channels (e.g., information streams from physical and virtual sensors that will be available to ASIST agents) and communication/action channels (e.g., mechanisms for agents to convey information to human teammates in the testbed and options they can use to engage with the team). ASIST agents must operate in increasingly complex and specialized environments; be adaptable to sudden perturbations in the mission or team, like the loss of communication with a key teammate; and use noisy multi-channel observations to represent the world and do complex inference and prediction. |/news-events/sail-on-proposers-day,SAIL-ON Proposers Day;/news-events/2020-01-27,OFFSET Swarm Systems Integrators Demonstrate Tactics to Conduct Urban Raid ;/news-events/2020-01-10,DARPA Names Qualifiers for the Subterranean Challenge Urban Circuit;/news-events/2019-03-21b,Using AI to Build Better Human-Machine Teams;/news-events/2019-02-14,Teaching AI Systems to Adapt to Dynamic Environments

To accomplish this goal, AIM will take a systems-level view of the response to vaccination and dissect the mechanisms that lead to long lasting protection. This systems-level understanding will then be implemented as a tool that can predict vaccine duration of protection and the associated mechanisms without waiting years for retrospective determination. |/news-events/2023-01-13.html,Teams Selected to Develop Vaccine Durability Prediction Tools;/news-events/2021-08-27.html,Taking Guess Work out of Vaccine Development;/news-events/breakthrough-biological-technologies-for-national-security.html,Breakthrough Biological Technologies for National Security;/news-events/preemptive-expression-of-protective-alleles-and-response-elements-proposers-day.html,PReemptive Expression of Protective Alleles and Response Elements (PREPARE) Proposers Day;/news-events/2019-06-27.html,A Dose of Inner Strength to Survive and Recover from Potentially Lethal Health Threats
Assured Autonomy|Autonomy refers to a system&rsquo;s ability to accomplish goals independently, or with minimal supervision from human operators in environments that are complex and unpredictable.  Autonomous systems are increasingly critical to several current and future Department of Defense (DoD) mission needs.|https://www.darpa.mil/JSON/program/assured-autonomy.json|I2O|Mr. William Martin|/staff/mr-william-martin.html|Autonomy,Supervised Autonomy,/tag-list.html?tag=Autonomy;Systems,Systems of Systems,/tag-list.html?tag=Systems|Autonomy refers to a system’s ability to accomplish goals independently, or with minimal supervision from human operators in environments that are complex and unpredictable.  Autonomous systems are increasingly critical to several current and future Department of Defense (DoD) mission needs. For example, the U.S. Army Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) strategy report for 2015-2040 identifies a range of capability objectives, including enhanced situational awareness, cognitive workload reduction, force protection, cyber defense, logistics, etc, that rely on autonomous systems and higher levels of autonomy.  Tremendous advances have been made in the last decade in constructing autonomous Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), as evidenced by the proliferation of a variety of unmanned systems: air, ground, sea, and undersea vehicles. These advances have been driven by innovations in several areas, such as sensor and actuator technologies, computing technologies, control theory, design methods and tools, modeling and simulation technologies, among others. In spite of these advances, deployment and broader adoption of such systems in safety-critical DoD applications remains challenging and controversial.Several factors impede the deployment and adoption of autonomous systems: In the absence of an adequately high level of autonomy that can be relied upon, substantial operator involvement is required, which not only severely limits operational gains, but creates significant new challenges in the areas of human-machine interaction and mixed initiative control. Achieving higher levels of autonomy in uncertain, unstructured, and dynamic environments, on the other hand, increasingly involves data-driven machine learning techniques with many open systems science and systems engineering challenges.Machine learning techniques widely used today are inherently unpredictable and lack the necessary mathematical framework to provide guarantees on correctness, while DoD applications that depend on safe and correct operation for mission success require predictable behavior and strong assurance.Historically, assurance has been approached through design processes following rigorous safety standards in development, and demonstrating compliance through system testing. However, these standards have been developed primarily for human-in-the-loop systems, and are bounded in scope, not extending to advanced levels of autonomy where system behavior depends on its memory of received stimuli. Current assurance approaches are predicated on the assumption that once the system is deployed, it does not learn and evolve. The goal of the Assured Autonomy program is to create technology for continual assurance of Learning-Enabled, Cyber Physical Systems (LE-CPSs). Continual assurance is defined as an assurance of the safety and functional correctness of the system provided provisionally at design time, and continually monitored, updated, and evaluated at operation-time as the system and its environment evolves. An LE-CPS is defined as a system composed of one or more Learning-enabled Components (LECs). A LEC is a component whose behavior is driven by “background knowledge” acquired and updated through a “learning process,” while operating in a dynamic and unstructured environment. This definition generalizes and admits a variety of popular machine learning approaches and algorithms (e.g., supervisory learning for training classifiers, reinforcement learning for developing control policies, algorithms for learning system dynamics). The generalization is intentional to promote abstractions and tools that can be applied to different types and applications of data-driven machine learning algorithms in Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) to enhance their autonomy. In order to ground the Assured Autonomy research objectives, the program will prioritize challenge problems in the militarily relevant autonomous vehicle space. However, it is anticipated that the tools, toolchains, and algorithms created will be relevant to other LE-CPSs.  The resulting technology from the program will be in the form of a set of publicly available tools integrated into LE-CPS design toolchains that will be made widely available for use in commercial and defense sectors.   |/news-events/ursa-proposers-day.html,URSA Proposers Day;/news-events/2020-01-29.html,Progressing Towards Assuredly Safer Autonomous Systems;/news-events/2017-08-16.html,DARPA Assured Autonomy Seeks to Guarantee Safety of Learning-enabled Autonomous Systems;/program/2016-11-28.html,Designing Agile Human-Machine Teams;/about-us/offices/special-projects-technology-transition.html,Special Projects and Technology Transition

Unlike commodity computers that have short upgrade cycles and are easily replaceable in case of failure, these computing devices are intended for longer service, and are hard to replace. Thus, the amount of deployed software that needs to be maintained is continually increasing, while the growing use of telemetry on such devices potentially exposes their software to cyber-attacks. To fix cybersecurity flaws in software, vendors distribute patched versions of the software. Unfortunately, even after a particular flaw has been fully understood, and a remediation approach has been developed and expressed as a source code change in the current version of the software, the ability of vendors to produce patches for all of their deployed devices in a timely, assuredly safe, and scalable manner is limited. Additional challenges arise when the exact source code version has been lost, the process for building the software from source code was not documented, and/or the original software development environment is not available. These limitations and challenges result in mission-critical software going unpatched for months to years, increasing the opportunity for attackers. The goal of the Assured Micropatching (AMP) program is to create the capability for rapid patching of legacy binaries in mission critical systems, including the cases where the original source code version and/or build process is not available. AMP aims to create new capabilities to analyze, modify, and fix legacy software in binary form,  capable of producing assured targeted micropatches for known security flaws in existing binaries. Micropatches change the fewest possible bytes to achieve their objective, which minimizes potential side effects, and should enable proofs that the patches will preserve the original baseline functionality of the system. With these proofs, the time to test and deploy the patched system should be reduced from months to days.To achieve this goal, the AMP program seeks to address gaps in the current software development paradigm through breakthroughs in and novel approaches to technical challenges, including but not limited to:Identifying modular units in executable binary images, and identifying modules’ interfaces, interactions, and linking artifacts to enable subsequent assured relinking and re-integration of patched binary modules;Decompiling the executable binary code into forms suitable for automatically situating a patch for a known security flaw existing in the binary;Generating minimal-change binary micropatches for existing binary images and for rigorous reasoning about their effects and testing these effects to verify noninterference of the changes with the binary’s baseline functionality; andUsing available sources of information, such as source code and binary samples, to recover missing relevant parts of the source code and the build process.|/news-events/hardening-development-toolchains-against-emergent-execution-engines-proposers-day.html,Hardening Development Toolchains Against Emergent Execution Engines (HARDEN) Proposers Day;/news-events/2022-10-13.html,DARPA Selects Teams to Protect Computers’ ‘Roots of Trust’ from Exploits;/news-events/2021-09-22.html,Disrupting Exploitable Patterns in Software to Make Systems Safer;/news-events/2021-04-22.html,Researchers Demonstrate Potential for Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Vulnerability Disclosure;/news-events/2019-07-18.html,Generating Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Defense Capabilities

ANSR defines a system as trustworthy, if it is: Robust to domain-informed and adversarial perturbations;Supported by an assurance framework that creates and analyzes heterogenous evidence towards safety and risk assessments; and Predictable with respect to some specification and models of fitness.Advances in assurance technologies, including formal and simulation-based approaches, have helped accelerate identification of failure modes and defects of machine learning (ML) algorithms. Unfortunately, the ability to repair defects in state-of-the-art ML remains limited to retraining, which is not guaranteed to eliminate defects or to improve the generalizability of ML algorithms. Further, while the runtime assurance architecture (e.g. monitoring and recovery) ensures operational safety, frequent invocations of fallback recovery, triggered by brittleness and generalizability of ML, compromises the ability to accomplish a mission. ANSR hypothesizes that several of the limitations in ML today are a consequence of the inability to incorporate contextual and background knowledge, and treating each data set as an independent, uncorrelated input. In the real world, observations are often correlated and a product of an underlying causal mechanism, which can be modeled and understood. ANSR also posits that hybrid AI algorithms capable of acquiring and integrating symbolic knowledge and performing symbolic reasoning at scale will deliver robust inference, generalize to new situations, and provide evidence for assurance and trust.The ANSR Broad Agency Announcement is available at https://sam.gov/opp/59cc5fec16c24ae0a2838b1b21e263a2/view|/news-events/2022-06-03.html,DARPA’s ANSR to Improving Trustworthy AI;/program/competency-aware-machine-learning.html,Competency-Aware Machine Learning ;/program/science-of-artificial-intelligence-and-learning-for-open-world-novelty.html,Science of Artificial Intelligence and Learning for Open-world Novelty;/program/serial-interactions-in-imperfect-information-games-applied-to-complex-military-decision-making.html,Serial Interactions in Imperfect Information Games Applied to Complex Military Decision Making ;/news-events/proposers-day-announcement-for-ace.html,Air Combat Evolution (ACE) Proposers Day

Those wave components travelling radially away from the center of the Earth will encounter decreasing air density with altitude thus reducing the amount of energy transferred to the atmosphere. This energy can propagate all the way to the bottomside of the ionosphere and has been detailed in the observational literature using various electromagnetic measuring techniques. AtmoSense seeks to understand the evolution of this energy through the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere (before it reaches the ionosphere).Understanding the basic fundamentals of atmospheric energy propagation from transient events could inform new detection techniques and hazard forecasting for activities on the Earth's surface. |/news-events/confers-proposers-day.html,CONFERS Proposers Day;/news-events/darpa-launch-challenge.html,DARPA Launch Challenge;/news-events/darpa-launch-challenge-competitors-day.html,DARPA Launch Challenge Competitors Day;/news-events/draco-proposers-day.html,DRACO Proposers Day;/news-events/global-satellite-servicing-forum.html,Global Satellite Servicing Forum

The Atomic Clock with Enhanced Stability (ACES) program aims to develop next-generation, battery-powered chip-scale atomic clocks (CSAC) with 1000X improvement in key performance parameters compared to existing CSAC technology.First-generation CSACs, developed under prior DARPA programs, are now available commercially and have demonstrated the feasibility and value of CSAC technology across DoD and civilian applications. These devices offer unprecedented timing stability within their domain of size, weight, and power (SWaP), but their performance is fundamentally limited—particularly in the key performance metrics of temperature sensitivity (tempco), long-term frequency aging, and turn-on to turn-on reproducibility (retrace)—due to the physics associated with the design of these devices.The ACES program is exploring alternative CSAC physics architectures with the objective of demonstrating a CSAC with 1000X improvement in tempco, aging, and retrace. The program includes engineering efforts to demonstrate SWaP reduction of laboratory-proven atomic clock technologies and to deliver ACES prototype clocks. The program also includes basic research efforts to explore novel component technologies and alternative physics approaches that have the potential to substantively impact future ACES clock architectures.|/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;/about-us/offices/sto/more.html,Strategic Technology Office;/news-events/microsystems-technology-office-proposers-day.html,Microsystems Technology Office Proposers Day;/news-events/sync-with-sto.html,Sync with STO;/news-events/2017-08-04.html,Strategic Technology Office Outlines Vision for “Mosaic Warfare”
Atomic Magnetometer for Biological Imaging In Earth’s Native Terrain (AMBIIENT) |The goal of the Atomic Magnetometer for Biological Imaging In Earth&rsquo;s Native Terrain (AMBIIENT) program is to develop novel gradient magnetic sensors that can detect biological signals while operating outside of specialized facilities and in the noisy ambient field of the Earth.|https://www.darpa.mil/JSON/program/atomic-magnetometer-for-biological-imaging-in-earths-native-terrain.json|MTO|Dr. Jonathan Hoffman|/staff/dr-jonathan-hoffman.html|Bio-Devices,Biological Devices,/tag-list.html?tag=Bio-Devices;PNT,Position, Navigation and Timing,/tag-list.html?tag=PNT;Sensors,Novel Sensing and Detection,/tag-list.html?tag=Sensors|State-of-the-art magnetometers are used for diverse civilian and DoD applications, among them biomedical imaging, navigation, and detecting unexploded ordnance and underwater and underground anomalies. Commercially available magnetometers range from inexpensive Hall probes to highly sensitive fluxgate and atomic magnetometers to high-precision Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) and Spin Exchange Relaxation Free (SERF) magnetometers. These devices generally have limited dynamic range: the lower-performing devices operate comfortably in the background ambient field of the Earth, while the highest performing sensors only operate in highly shielded, expensive, special-purpose laboratory facilities. The goal of the Atomic Magnetometer for Biological Imaging in Earth’s Native Terrain (AMBIIENT) program is to develop novel gradient magnetic sensors that can detect biological signals while operating outside of specialized facilities and in the noisy ambient field of the Earth.A successful AMBIIENT program will lead to sensors that offer a unique capability for dynamic imaging of biological processes with extensive applications in both biomedical research and clinical diagnosis, including magnetoencephalography and magnetocardiography. Recent studies have demonstrated emerging applications in spinal signal detection, diagnosis of mild Traumatic Brain Injury, and in Brain-Machine Interfaces.The AMBIIENT program seeks to develop next-generation sensors that directly measure magnetic field gradients over short distances rather than subtracting magnetic signals from two separate total field magnetometers. Such sensors would produce a signal that is directly proportional to the magnetic field gradient, thereby providing high common mode rejection without requiring extraordinarily high dynamic range in each sensor. The success of AMBIIENT requires invention and development of novel physics-based techniques and sensor architectures that directly measure magnetic field gradient rather than total field.|/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;/news-events/ambiient-proposers-day.html,AMBIIENT Proposers Day;/news-events/2021-01-13.html,Episode 38: The Oceanic Defender;/news-events/2020-07-07.html,Episode 30: The Sensor Sorcerer;/news-events/2017-03-17.html,Taking Animal Magnetism to the Extreme

Two areas of great promise are frequency metrology using optically probed trapped atom clocks and inertial sensing using optically cooled atom interferometry. Together, they could form the basis of a fully autonomous navigation and timing system, free from GPS. However, replicating these devices even at laboratory scale is still resource intensive, while integration of these laboratory-based quantum devices into a practical size, weight, and power has proven very challenging.The largest contributor to this problem is the optical system; it must interface the collection of visible through near-infrared lasers and detectors to a gas of atoms contained in a vacuum cell. For optical atomic clocks and gyroscopes that use trapped atoms, this optical system comprises hundreds of individually aligned optics that form a photonic circuit. The Atomic-Photonic Integration (A-PhI) program seeks to reduce the barriers of integration and development by developing the equivalent optical system to these devices as a photonic integrated circuit (PIC). The target PIC will perform the functions of laser cooling, trapping, probing, and detection.A-PhI aims to develop PICs for two device categories – clocks and gyroscopes. With each device category, there is at least one additional significant challenge. In the case of the atomic clock, the PIC(s) will require frequency micro-combs to enable optical frequency division for ultra-low phase noise microwave output. This would generate the world’s best microwave oscillator combination when considering the combinations of phase noise and volume. In the case of the atomic gyroscope, the challenge is matching or exceeding the un-trapped atom device performance in trapped-atom systems that are amenable to interfacing with PICs. The program goal is to reduce the most significant technical challenges associated with miniaturizing and developing quantum devices to a fabrication problem capable of being implemented at scale in a foundry. |/news-events/lasers-for-universal-microscale-optical-systems-proposers-day.html,Lasers for Universal Microscale Optical Systems (LUMOS) Proposers Day;/news-events/photonics-in-the-package-for-extreme-scalability-proposers-day.html,Photonics in the Package for Extreme Scalability (PIPES) Proposers Day;/news-events/2022-01-27.html,DARPA Researchers Use Light on Chip to Drive Next-Generation RF Platforms;/news-events/2021-10-12.html,Episode 50: The Photonicist;/news-events/2021-07-07.html,Blackjack Program Successfully Deploys Two Mandrake 2 Satellites
Automated Rapid Certification Of Software (ARCOS) |The process of determining that a software system&rsquo;s risk is acceptable is referred to as &ldquo;certification.&rdquo; Current certification practices within the Department of Defense (DoD) are antiquated and unable to scale with the amount of software deployed.

Two factors prevent scaling: (a) the use of human evaluators to determine if the system meets certification criteria, and (b) the lack of a principled means to decompose evaluations.The amount of assurance evidence needed to determine software conformance to certification can be overwhelming to human subject matter experts, resulting in superficial, incomplete, and/or unacceptably long evaluations. Human evaluators also have unique expertise, experience, and biases that influence their approach to evaluations. Because certification requirements may be vague or poorly written, evaluators often must interpret what is intended. Combined, these factors result in inconsistencies over time and across evaluations. Currently, there is no means to compose evaluations in a principled and trustworthy manner. Composed evaluations would allow subsystems or components to be evaluated independently. The results of those independent evaluations could then be leveraged as assurance evidence in the composed systems. This would amortize the effort of evaluating any component over all systems using that component. Current practice requires re-evaluating components and their assurance evidence in every system that employs them. The inability to use a divide–and-conquer approach to certification of large systems increases the cost and time required to perform these certifications.The goal of the Automated Rapid Certification Of Software (ARCOS) program is to automate the evaluation of software assurance evidence to enable certifiers to determine rapidly that system risk is acceptable. Two factors support the acceleration of software certification through the automation of evaluations. First, the DoD has articulated its intentions to have its contractors modernize their engineering processes in the DoD Digital Engineering Strategy. The goal of this strategy is to move away from document-based engineering processes and towards design models that are to be the authoritative source of truth for systems. Such a future does not lend itself to current certification practices, but it will facilitate the automated evaluation of assurance. Second, advances in several technologies provide a basis for confidence that automated evaluation of assurance evidence to support certification is possible. Model-based design technology, including probabilistic model checking, may enable reasoning over a design in a way that quantifies uncertainty. So-called “Big Code” analytics have pioneered the application of semantic-based analytics to software and its associated artifacts. Mathematically rigorous analysis and verification provide the ability to develop software implementations that are demonstrably correct and sound. Assurance case languages provide us a means for expressing arguments on how software fulfills its certification goals, in a manner that is machine-readable.ARCOS will explore techniques for automating the evidence generation process for new and legacy software; create a means of curating evidence while maintaining its provenance; and develop technologies for the automated construction of assurance cases, as well as technologies that can validate and assess the confidence of an assurance case argument. The evidence generation, curation, and assessment technologies will form the ARCOS tools and processes, working collectively to provide a scalable means of accelerating the pathway to certification.For more information please visit the Automated Rapid Certification of Software (ARCOS) Proposers Day webpage available here.

Despite growing recognition of the issue, there are no common tools, methods, or solutions for chip-level security currently in wide use. This is largely driven by the economic hurdles and technical trade-offs often associated with secure chip design. Further, modern chip design methods are unforgiving – once a chip is designed, adding security after the fact or making changes to address newly discovered threats is nearly impossible.The Automatic Implementation of Secure Silicon (AISS) program aims to ease the burden of developing secure chips. AISS seeks to create a novel, automated chip design flow that will allow security mechanisms to scale consistently with the goals of a chip design.

By bringing greater automation to the chip design process, the burden of security inclusion can be profoundly decreased.While the threat landscape is ever evolving and expansive, AISS seeks to address four specific attack surfaces that are most relevant to digital ASICs and SoCs. These include side channel attacks, reverse engineering attacks, supply chain attacks, and malicious hardware attacks. As strategies for resisting threats vary widely in cost, complexity, and invasiveness, AISS will help designers assess which defense mechanisms are most appropriate based on the potential attack surface and the likelihood of a compromise.In addition to incorporating scalable defense mechanisms, AISS seeks to ensure that the IP blocks that make up a chip remain secure throughout the design process and are not compromised as they move through the ecosystem. As such, the program aims to move forward provenance and integrity validation techniques for preexisting design components by advancing current methods or inventing novel technical approaches. |/news-events/2018-01-09.html,Configuration Security Program to Make Network-Connected Systems Less Vulnerable;/news-events/automated-rapid-certification-of-software-proposers-day.html,Automated Rapid Certification Of Software (ARCOS) Proposers Day;/news-events/chess-proposers-day.html,CHESS Proposers Day;/news-events/cyber-grandchallenge.html,Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) Final Event;/news-events/darpa-finding-exploits-to-thwart-tampering.html,DARPA Finding Exploits to Thwart Tampering (FETT) Bug Bounty Capture-the-Flag Qualifier

For example, it’s unlikely one would build a new aircraft, rocket, or car engine without first conducting exhaustive simulations using a computational model of the design. The outputs of computational models from many domains, including social and biophysical sciences, are even written directly into policy and regulation at every level of administration, making modeling and simulation critical for Department of Defense operational and strategic planning, and analysis.  Despite this importance, the process of discovering, creating, maintaining, validating, and using expert knowledge and models remains manual, time-consuming, and prone to technical and conceptual errors.  For example, current modeling pipelines fail to maintain relevant inputs, assumptions, and modeling choices made during development. Rapidly changing knowledge, semantically-opaque models, and black-box simulators make it almost impossible to maintain a coherent approach to scientific modeling and simulation, resulting in poor expert decision-support. Building on the Automating Scientific Knowledge Extraction (ASKE) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Exploration effort,  DARPA’s Automating Scientific Knowledge Extraction and Modeling (ASKEM) program will use AI approaches and tools to create, sustain, and enhance complex models and simulators. These tools will enable experts to maintain, reuse, and adapt large collections of heterogeneous data, knowledge and models – with traceability across knowledge sources, model assumptions, and model fitness. Program performers will apply the models and simulators to various use cases with a focus on modeling of viral epidemics such as COVID-19, and to the causes and impacts of space weather.If successful, ASKEM will enable a dramatic acceleration in scientific and engineering advances, improve scientific collaboration, and lead to timelier and more reliable expert guidance to support threat detection, interventions, and decision-making, especially in rapidly evolving environments and mission-critical domains.

Linear processing of the signal from the antenna to the detector has been retained in this evolution. The tremendous increase in processing capability enables a fresh look into radar signal processing. BLiP is based on the premise that when more physically realistic target and environment models are used as the basis for the radar estimation and detection problem, then solutions require non-linear and iterative signal processing. Non-linear and iterative techniques have the potential to significantly improve radar performance such that smaller radar apertures and thus smaller platforms can provide equivalent capability.BLiP will address the current immaturity of non-linear and iterative signal processing methods. Over the course of this program, end-to-end radar signal processing chains will be developed, analyzed, implemented and tested; initially through non-real-time laboratory testing and culminating in real-time implementation and full-scale field testing. Key technical challenges for BLiP will be the development, understanding, and optimization of the signal processing chain, and the practical aspects of implementing BLiP algorithms in real-time in current high performance processing.|/news-events/2022-10-25.html,Revolutionizing Radar Signal Processing;/work-with-us/beyond-linear-processing.html,Beyond Linear Processing (BLiP) ;https://sam.gov/opp/37ec023e75b64a69bc05236517a73578/view.html,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) RFI;https://sam.gov/opp/643088c8b2d84341ab92ce7ff00babee/view.html,Strategic Technology Office (STO) Office-wide;/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced

The DoD relies on steel-reinforced concrete structures such as missile silos and naval piers that are many decades old, not easily replaced, and subject to cracking and corrosive deterioration. The DoD also relies on concrete airfield pavements in expeditionary settings, which are vulnerable to damage from overuse or attack and require rapid repair under challenging circumstances. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art approaches to maintain concrete are one-time interventions, limited to remediation of defects at or near the surface, and typically necessitate down-time for critical assets. No current technology provides ongoing crack repair and prevention for defects deep inside existing aged concrete or prolonged repair of damaged airfield pavements. Inspired by vascular systems that support repair in multicellular organisms and ecosystems, the BRACE program will develop bio-inspired approaches that 1) integrate deep within aged concrete to form a healing “vasculature” for ongoing damage repair; and 2) combine with new concrete to increase the durability of runway patch repairs.  |/news-events/2023-03-23.html,Concrete in Disrepair?

DARPA’s Blackjack program aims to develop and demonstrate the critical elements for a global high-speed network in low Earth orbit (LEO) that provides the Department of Defense with highly connected, resilient, and persistent coverage.  Blackjack seeks to incorporate commercial sector advances in LEO, including design of LEO constellations intended for broadband internet service, of which the design and manufacturing could offer economies of scale previously unavailable. DARPA is interested in capitalizing on these advances to demonstrate military utility, emphasizing a commoditized bus and low-cost interchangeable payloads with short design cycles and frequent technology upgrades. The key program objectives are:  Develop payload and mission-level autonomy software and demonstrate autonomous orbital operations including on-orbit distributed decision processors. Develop and implement advanced commercial manufacturing for military payloads and the spacecraft bus.  Demonstrate payloads in LEO to augment NSS assets. The driver will be to show LEO performance that is on par with current systems in geosynchronous orbit with the spacecraft combined bus, payload(s), and launch costs under $6 million per orbital node while the payloads meet size, weight, and power constraints of the commercial bus.   |/news-events/darpa-launch-challenge.html,DARPA Launch Challenge;/news-events/darpa-launch-challenge-competitors-day.html,DARPA Launch Challenge Competitors Day;/news-events/2020-05-11.html,Blackjack Focuses on Risk Reduction Flights and Simulations to Prepare for Full Demonstration;/news-events/2019-10-22.html,DARPA Updates Competitor Field for Flexible, Responsive Launch to Orbit;/news-events/2019-04-10.html,Three Teams Qualify to Compete in DARPA Launch Challenge

To achieve this combinatorial approach, BG+ teams will build two systems of implantable and adaptive devices. The first system will reduce injury effects during the early phases of spinal cord injury. This system will consist of active devices that conduct real-time biomarker monitoring and intervention to stabilize – and where possible, rebuild – the neural communications pathways at the site of injury. Biomarker monitoring will provide previously unavailable diagnostic information for automated or clinician-directed interventions. The second system will primarily address recovery of function in the final phase of spinal cord injury by deploying networks of stimulation and/or recording devices on the nervous system or relevant end organs to effectively “bridge the gap” of the spinal cord injury. The BG+ program seeks to change the paradigm for spinal cord injury treatment. Successful BG+ devices will mitigate the early effects of injury, enhance clinical awareness and therapeutic options at the injury site, accelerate natural long-term recovery processes, and restore multiple nervous system functions. |/news-events/2020-11-09.html,DARPA Awards Contracts for Work on Spinal Cord Injury Treatment;/news-events/2019-10-17.html,New Generation of Intelligent Bio-Interfaces Could Overcome Aspects of Spinal Cord Injury;/news-events/2022-11-15.html,DARPA Seeks Novel Approaches to Improve Mental Health, Prevent Suicide;/news-events/2022-04-04.html,Episode 55: Sensorized Prosthetics;/news-events/2016-10-26.html,Neuroscience of Touch Supports Improved Robotic and Prosthetic Interfaces

Causal Exploration of Complex Operational Environments  (Causal Exploration) |Over the last 15 years, the U.S. military has increasingly been called upon to face complex operational environments (OE) and diverse enemies. Such complex OEs require the actions of U.S. forces and host-nation or coalition partners to be based on a common holistic understanding of the OE (e.g., governments, population groups, security forces, and violent non-state actors) and, in particular, the causal dynamics that can manifest as unanticipated and often counter-intuitive outcomes.|https://www.darpa.mil/JSON/program/causal-exploration.json|I2O|Dr. Matthew Marge|/staff/dr-matthew-marge.html|Analytics,Analytics for Data at Massive Scales,/tag-list.html?tag=Analytics;BMC2,Battle Management, Command and Control,/tag-list.html?tag=BMC2;Forecasting,Forecasting,/tag-list.html?tag=Forecasting|Over the last 15 years, the U.S. military has increasingly been called upon to face complex operational environments (OE) and diverse enemies.

While a range of modeling and simulation tools exist within military commands, most are special-purpose and extensive time and effort are often required to configure and use these tools. Existing tools are also heavily dependent on databases with no automated mechanism for keeping them current. These tools are not generally suitable for use directly by operational planners as they require expert modelers to assemble, configure, run, and interpret the outputs.Causal Exploration seeks to develop a modeling platform to aid military planners in understanding and addressing underlying causal factors that drive complex conflict situations.  The technologies embodied in the Causal Exploration platform will enable users to rapidly create, maintain, and interact with a causal model that has been tailored for the operational environment they are facing. Interaction with the model will allow users to explore the causal dynamics driving the conflict, and gain in-depth understanding of the operational environment to support and inform their planning efforts. While this capability will have broad applicability, the program will focus on hybrid or irregular conflicts, which are dominated by complex human  dynamics with intertwining political, territorial, economic, ethnic, and/or religious tensions.  |/news-events/ground-truth-proposers-day.html,Ground Truth Proposers Day April 20, 2017;/news-events/systematizing-confidence-in-open-research-and-evidence-proposers-day.html,Systematizing Confidence in Open Research and Evidence (SCORE) Proposers Day;/news-events/2022-07-13.html,DARPA 'SNAPs' Up New Tools for Predicting Warfighter Readiness;/news-events/2017-04-07.html,Putting Social Science Modeling Through Its Paces;/program/ground-truth.html,Ground Truth

During Department of Defense (DoD) Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response (HA/DR) operations, relief efforts would benefit from a stable and constructive information environment that naturally facilitates informative dialogue. However, rather than aiding users in finding common ground, online social environments worldwide often fall prey to disinformation, bullying, and malicious rhetoric, which may be perpetuated through broader social dynamics linked to toxic and uncritical group conformity. New technologies are required to preserve and promote the positive factors of engagement in online discourse while minimizing the risk of negative social and psychological impacts emerging from violations of platform community guidelines. Civil Sanctuary aims to provide technologies capable of supporting DoD humanitarian assistance efforts by facilitating online social environments where positive behavioral norms – those linked to the productive sharing of information, particularly during crises – are encouraged locally in user conversations through the use of multilingual AI moderators. This program will exceed current content moderation capabilities by expanding the moderation paradigm from detection/deletion to proactive, cooperative engagement. Extending current research in computational dialogue and cognitive modeling, artificial agents created under this program will learn best practices for online mediation by observing human experts and then employ these skills to interactively guide user groups to adhere to community guidelines. Civil Sanctuary will scale the moderation capability of current platforms, enabling a quicker response to emerging issues and creating a more stable information environment, while simultaneously teaching users more beneficial behaviors that mitigate harmful reactive impulses, including mitigating the uncritical acceptance and amplification of destructive ideas as a means to assert group conformity. The program will demonstrate novel and generalizable technologies that commercial platforms may leverage via third-party vendors.

Coded Visibility will explore passive methods to achieve this asymmetry (i.e., passive asymmetry), using tailorable obscurants deployed in relevant environments. Additionally, Coded Visibility will focus on the longer-term technical goal of actively modulating novel particulates, potentially enabling dynamic control of an obscurant’s properties post-deployment and cooperation with sensor modalities (i.e., active asymmetry). Across both passive and active thrusts, the program will focus on identifying obscurants that are safe for the warfighter.   |/news-events/2022-08-16a.html,Work Begins on Next Generation of Battlefield Obscurants;/news-events/2021-10-12a.html,Seeing through the Fog of War;/program/nascent-light-matter-interactions.html,Nascent Light-Matter Interactions;/news-events/nascent-light-matter-interactions-webcast-proposers-day.html,Nascent Light-Matter Interactions (NLM) Webcast Proposers Day;/news-events/2023-01-23.html,Liquid-Mirror Program to Revolutionize Telescope Designs

Advanced silicon (Si) complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology has enabled this integration, but has also led to a rise in costs associated with design and processing. Driven by aggressive digital CMOS scaling for high-volume products, Intellectual Property (IP) reuse has emerged as a tool to help lower design costs associated with advanced SoCs. The monolithic nature of state-of-the-art SoCs is not always acceptable for Department of Defense (DoD) or other low-volume applications due to factors such as high initial prototype costs and requirements for alternative material sets. To enhance overall system flexibility and reduce design time for next-generation products, the Common Heterogeneous Integration and Intellectual Property (IP) Reuse Strategies (CHIPS) program seeks to establish a new paradigm in IP reuse.The vision of CHIPS is an ecosystem of discrete modular, reusable IP blocks, which can be assembled into a system using existing and emerging integration technologies. Modularity and reusability of IP blocks will require electrical and physical interface standards to be widely adopted by the community supporting the CHIPS ecosystem. Therefore, the CHIPS program will develop the design tools and integration standards required to demonstrate modular integrated circuit (IC) designs that leverage the best of DoD and commercial designs and technologies. |/news-events/electronics-resurgence-initiative-summit.html,Electronics Resurgence Initiative Summit;/news-events/2021-12-22.html,DARPA Joins Public-Private Partnership to Address Challenges Facing Microelectronics Advancement;/news-events/2020-06-17.html,DARPA Announces Third-Annual Electronics Resurgence Initiative Summit & MTO Symposium;/news-events/2019-05-31.html,DARPA Announces ERI Summit 2019 Workshops;/news-events/2019-04-05.html,DARPA Announces Second Annual ERI Summit

COFFEE aims to develop a new class of integrable, high-frequency RF filters for next-generation wideband arrays. The COFFEE filter technology will address the combination of size, performance, and reproducibility to enable protection at every element of a wideband AESA. COFFEE aims to build integrable filters that operate over a wide range of frequencies that are also small enough to fit behind each element of the phased array thus making the array more robust and resistant to interference. Key to the program is the development of filter technology that can address all microwave frequencies of a wideband AESA’s bandwidth without sacrificing performance. Further, the target filters must be physically small compared to the element area as the available space for element-level integration decreases significantly as AESA bandwidth increases. Finally, to ensure uniformity the COFFEE filters should be manufacturable with reproducible performance at each of the array elements.A main focus of the research will be on developing a new class of resonators and integrable microwave filters that address COFFEE’s technical objectives. In addition, research studies into compact mm-wave resonators will be conducted to inform new technical approaches for potential future efforts for integrable mm-wave filters.COFFEE is a part of DARPA’s Electronics Resurgence Initiative (ERI) – a five-year, $1.5 billion investment in the advancement of the U.S. semiconductor industry. The program addresses a key ERI focus area of revolutionizing communications for the 5G era and beyond. |/news-events/2022-11-23.html,Cranking the Power on Radar Capabilities ;/news-events/2022-06-01.html,COFFEE Program Jump-Starts Integrable Filtering for Wideband Superiority;/news-events/2021-06-10.html,Filtering Out Interference for Next-Generation Wideband Arrays;/news-events/2018-04-25.html,Achieving Unprecedented Frequency Control in Miniature Lasers ;/news-events/2018-01-24.html,DARPA Seeks to Improve Military Communications with  Digital Phased-Arrays at Millimeter Wave

DARPA is pursuing an approach to cyber resilience that would subdivide software systems into smaller, secure compartments that prevent an initial attempt at penetration from becoming a successful attack.Through its new Compartmentalization and Privilege Management (CPM) program, the agency seeks to develop tools that can automatically restructure a software system into many small compartments, each with a specific function and operating with the least privilege necessary to achieve its goals. Systems running software with least privilege compartments would be much more resistant to cyber attackers.With processor hardware enhancements, fine-grained software compartmentalization would not significantly impact the system’s speed and efficiency. The challenge, however, is in the billions of lines of existing software, all of which would be impossibly time-consuming to rewrite in safer programming languages.Legacy systems over their lifetimes tend to become more unstructured and consequently less compartmentalized. The goal of CPM will be to transform existing systems into resilient ones that prevent most cyber-attack campaigns from succeeding even if an adversary gains a foothold. Successful CPM research will demonstrate the analysis and enforcement technologies necessary for compartmentalization of large-scale systems with high confidence and low development effort. Though CPM will focus on securing the vulnerable legacy code base, resulting solutions should also apply to new software. CPM is a four-year program with two phases. Phase 1 will focus on technology development, specifically using the Linux operating system as the test and evaluation suite. Phase 2 will focus on demonstrating scalable capabilities on open-source systems representative of classes of computation important to the Department of Defense.A Broad Agency Announcement solicitation with all program details is available on SAM.gov at this link: https://sam.gov/opp/d624b5ffc9d24e38b966a714cbbb4f7d/view  HR001123S0028: Proposers Day Recording|/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;https://sam.gov/opp/836e18e03ba445d1b617b546b14d5bdd/view.html,Compartmentalization and Privilege Management (CPM);/news-events/hierarchical-identify-verify-exploit-proposers-day.html,Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) Proposers Day;/news-events/measuring-biological-aptitude-proposers-day.html,Measuring Biological Aptitude (MBA) Proposers Day;/news-events/proposers-day-for-atomic-clocks-with-enhanced-stability-program.html,Proposers Day for Atomic Clocks with Enhanced Stability (ACES) Program

Communicative understanding, not simply of local languages, but also of social customs and cultural backgrounds, lies at the heart of Civil Affairs and Military Information Support Operations activities, which together comprise the vast majority of U.S. counterinsurgency and stabilization efforts. Cross-cultural miscommunication not only derails negotiations, but also can be a contributing factor leading to war. The likelihood of communicative failure increases dramatically where significant social, cultural, or ideological differences exist.Automated systems would be a welcome force-multiplier for DoD interpreters. However, unlike the human cultural interpreters who enable U.S. forces today, such systems are currently incapable of accurately analyzing cross-cultural communication or providing useful assistance to negotiations beyond basic machine translation.The Computational Cultural Understanding (CCU) program aims to create cross-cultural language understanding technologies to improve a DoD operator’s situational awareness and interactional effectiveness. CCU seeks to build natural language processing technologies that recognize, adapt to, and recommend how to operate within the emotional, social, and cultural norms that differ across societies, languages, and group affinities. To support diverse and emergent use cases, CCU will explore technologies engineered to require minimal-to-no training data in a local culture, while maximizing operator success during negotiations and other interactions in the field. Instead of relying primarily on annotated training data, target systems will leverage qualitative and quantitative findings from fields such as psychology, sociology, or other relevant disciplines, as well as minimally-supervised machine learning techniques, in order to infer the meaning of unlabeled discourse behaviors in context.  To achieve relative parity with human interpreters, who provide cultural insight and leverage this knowledge in the translation process, CCU research aims to provide foundational technical innovations to assist negotiators and analysts with language analysis and cross-cultural dialogue in the field. These advances in the area of cross-cultural understanding will also inform processes for training and planning.Despite remarkable recent advances in machine learning and multimedia analysis, today’s human language technology applications are inadequate for cross-cultural communicative analysis. To remedy these deficiencies and advance communication technology towards enablement of greater cultural understanding, the CCU program will focus on the following research topics:Automatic discovery of sociocultural norms.Generalization of emotion recognition across cultures.Detecting impactful changes in communicative practice at multiple timescales.

Securing this diverse technology base requires highly skilled hackers who reason about the functionality of software and identify novel vulnerabilities. This process requires hundreds, if not thousands of hours of manual effort per discovered vulnerability and does not scale sufficiently to secure the continuously growing technology base. Hackers use program analysis techniques and tools to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, but this process requires considerable expertise, manual effort, and time. Automated program analysis capabilities can reason over only a few vulnerability classes without human involvement, such as memory corruption or integer overflow, but cannot address the majority of vulnerabilities. These unaddressed vulnerability types depend on subtle semantic and contextual information, which is beyond the grasp of modern automation. Scaling up existing approaches to address the size and complexity of modern software packages is not possible given the limited number of expert hackers in the world, much less the DoD.The Computers and Humans Exploring Software Security (CHESS) program aims to develop capabilities to discover and address vulnerabilities of all types in a scalable, timely, and consistent manner. Achieving the necessary scale and timelines in vulnerability discovery will require innovative combinations of automated program analysis techniques with support for advanced computer-human collaboration. Due to the cost and scarcity of expert hackers, such capabilities must be able to collaborate with humans of varying skill levels, even those with no previous hacking experience or relevant domain knowledge.The CHESS program will research the effectiveness of enabling computers and humans to collaboratively reason over software artifacts, such as source code and compiled binaries, with the goal of finding 0-day vulnerabilities at a scale and speed appropriate for the complex software ecosystem upon which the U.S. Government, military, and economy depend. Achieving these goals will require research breakthroughs in:Developing instrumentation to capture and analyze the process by which hackers reason over software artifacts to provide a basis for developing new forms of highly effective communication and information sharing between computers and humans; Creating techniques for addressing classes of vulnerability that are currently hampered by information gaps and require human insight and/or contextually sensitive reasoning;Generating representations of the information gaps for human collaborators of varying skill levels to reason over;Integrating human-generated insights into the vulnerability discovery process;Emitting a Proof of Vulnerability to confirm existence of the 0-day vulnerability, and generating a non-disruptive, specific patch to neutralize the 0-day vulnerability; andSynthesizing vulnerable Challenge Set corpora representative of large, real world, complex software packages.The CHESS Broad Agency Announcement is available at https://beta.sam.gov/opp/557cfe6440e774224a008f6923e526f3/view |/news-events/chess-proposers-day.html,CHESS Proposers Day;/news-events/2018-04-18a.html,Applying Computer-Human Collaboration to Accelerate Detection of Zero-Day Vulnerabilities;/news-events/cyber-grandchallenge.html,Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) Final Event;/news-events/mayhem-crs-at-the-smithsonian.html,Mayhem CRS at the Smithsonian!;/news-events/military-invention-day-at-the-smithsonian.html,Military Invention Day at the Smithsonian

If successful, the program could significantly reduce the logistical burden of food transportation associated with deployed military operations and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) operations. To address vulnerabilities in food supply chains across a variety of operational and humanitarian scenarios, Cornucopia will demonstrate the capacity to produce all four human dietary macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate, fat, and dietary fiber) in ratios that target Military Dietary Reference Intake (MDRI) daily requirements for complete nutrition. Outputs will be in multiple food formats (e.g., shake, bar, gel, jerky) that meet military nutritional standards and palatability requirements in a system minimizing inputs, handling, and footprint.Cornucopia is a four-year program with three focus areas: domestication of microbes for human consumption; tailorability of microbial-origin food for different flavors, formats and nutritional composition; and integrated system demonstrations benchmarked by two military use cases, a small forward-operating military unit in austere conditions and a HADR scenario.Proposers Day VideoMr. Peter Donaghue, DARPA Contracts Management OfficeHow to propose to the Cornucopia program: 0:00 – 11:17Dr. Phil Root, Acting Director, DARPA Defense Sciences Office (DSO)DARPA overview & unique role of the Defense Sciences Office in revolutionary R&D: 11:18 – 22:29Dr. Molly Jahn, Cornucopia Program Manager in DSODetails & vision for the Cornucopia program: 22:30 – 58:03|/news-events/cornucopia-proposers-day.html,Cornucopia Proposers Day;/news-events/2023-02-03.html,Teams Begin Work to Develop Tasty Food from Air, Water, and Electricity;/news-events/2021-12-02.html,A Cornucopia of Microbial Foods;/news-events/2022-05-26.html,Voices from DARPA Episode 56- The Future of Food: Meals from Microbes;/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced
Critical Mineral Assessments with AI Support  (CriticalMAAS) |Critical minerals are defined as commodities essential to the U.S. economy and national security with significant supply chain vulnerabilities.

The supply of many critical minerals remains highly vulnerable to disruption due to high levels of import reliance, particularly on unstable or even adversarial nations. Clean energy infrastructure, along with many other next-generation technologies, consume more critical minerals than traditional energy sources, and expected demand for critical minerals used in clean energy will quadruple by 2040.In addition to assessing the nation’s mineral resources, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) tracks production, use, and trade statistics for over 100 commodities; 50 of which exceed criticality thresholds owing to high supply risk. Critical Mineral Assessments with AI Support (CriticalMAAS) aims to develop artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools to automate and accelerate key, time-consuming parts of USGS’ critical mineral assessment workflow. The goal of this AI exploration effort is to transform the workflow from a serial, predominantly manual, intermittently updated approach, to a highly parallel, continuous AI-assisted capability that is comprehensive in scope, efficient in scale, and generalizable across an array of applications. The Energy Act of 2020 called for the USGS to assess all critical mineral resources in the U.S. In addition, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law called on the USGS to assess potential critical mineral resources in mine waste. These assessments can quantify potential mineral sources from existing domestic mines – whether historical or active – and help identify opportunities for economically and environmentally viable resource development.The challenge is that critical mineral assessments are labor intensive and using traditional techniques, assessing all 50 critical minerals would proceed too slowly to address present-day supply chain needs.An AI-assisted workflow could enable the USGS to accomplish its mission, produce high-quality derivative products from raw input data, and deliver timely assessments that reduce exploration risk and support decisions affecting the management of strategic domestic resources. While the primary focus will be critical minerals, it is expected that the resulting technologies and resulting data products will be valuable for a wide variety of U.S. government mission areas ranging from water resource management, to potential new clean energy sources.The CriticalMAAS Broad Agency Announcement is available at: https://sam.gov/opp/4d53a0f7461e4e51b36495f9d0ec199c/view  |/news-events/artificial-intelligence-for-critical-mineral-assessment-competition,Artificial Intelligence for Critical Mineral Assessment Competition;/news-events/2022-12-16,DARPA Announces Winners of AI for Critical Mineral Assessment Competition ;/news-events/2022-08-15,DARPA Critical Minerals Competition Uses AI to Accelerate Analytics;/news-events/artificial-intelligence-colloquium,Artificial Intelligence Colloquium;/news-events/hierarchical-identify-verify-exploit-proposers-day,Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) Proposers Day

Cyber Assured Systems Engineering  (CASE) |Embedded computing systems are ubiquitous in critical infrastructure, vehicles, smart devices, and military systems.

Conventional wisdom once held that cyberattacks against embedded systems were not a concern since they seldom had traditional networking connections on which an attack could occur. However, attackers have learned to bridge air gaps that surround the most sensitive embedded systems, and network connectivity is now being extended to even the most remote of embedded systems. In short, embedded systems are now subject to cyberattacks, either as the end goal of the cyber assailant or as a means to a greater end, and there is a critical need to protect and defend embedded systems in a cyber-context. The mechanisms currently employed to secure embedded systems include development of software using cyber best practices, adapting mechanisms from information technology (IT) systems, and penetration testing followed by patching.  Unfortunately, these methods have proven to be generally ineffective. Critical systems are built by requirements-based engineering and it is an accepted axiom of systems engineering that requirements are positive, testable statements about the system—statements on the systems’ functional behaviors and non-functional properties often captured as “shall” statements. This style of engineering has proven to be ineffective in engineering cyber resilient systems because cyber requirements are often statements on what the system should not do, i.e., “shall not” statements. The goal of CASE is to develop the necessary design, analysis and verification tools to allow system engineers to design-in cyber resiliency and manage tradeoffs as they do other nonfunctional properties when designing complex embedded computing systems. Cyber resiliency means the system is tolerant to cyberattacks in the same way that safety critical systems are tolerant to random faults—they recover and continue to execute their mission function. Achieving this goal requires research breakthroughs in:the elicitation of cyber resiliency requirements before the system is built; the design and verification of systems when requirements are not testable (i.e., when they are expressed in shall not statements);tools to automatically adapt software to new non-functional requirements; andtechniques to scale and provide meaningful feedback from analysis tools that reside low in the development tool chain.The CASE BAA is available at https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=3353e66b84ebc0e87b2e5e263c3da5a4&tab=core&_cview=1  |/news-events/seL4Summit.html,seL4 Summit;/news-events/2019-05-03.html,Expediting Software Certification for Military Systems, Platforms;/news-events/2013-12-04a.html,Verigames Portal Offers the Chance to Do Serious IT Security While Playing Online;/program/automated-program-analysis-for-cybersecurity.html,Automated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity ;/program/automated-rapid-certification-of-software.html,Automated Rapid Certification Of Software
Cyber-Hunting at Scale  (CHASE) |Networks within the United States and abroad face increasingly broad-spectrum cyber threats from numerous actors and novel attack vectors. Malicious activity also crosscuts organizational boundaries, as nefarious actors use networks with less protection to pivot into networks containing key assets. Detection of these threats requires adjustments to network and host sensors at machine speed. Additionally, the data required to detect these threats may be distributed across devices and networks. In all of these cases, the threat actors are using technology to perpetrate their attacks and hide their activities and movement, both physical and virtual, inside DoD, commercial, and Internet Access Provider (IAP) networks.|https://www.darpa.mil/JSON/program/cyber-hunting-at-scale.json|I2O|Mr. Tejas Patel|/staff/mr-tejas-patel.html|Analytics,Analytics for Data at Massive Scales,/tag-list.html?tag=Analytics;Cyber,Cyber,/tag-list.html?tag=Cyber;Data,Data Analysis at Massive Scales,/tag-list.html?tag=Data|Networks within the United States and abroad face increasingly broad-spectrum cyber threats from numerous actors and novel attack vectors.

In all of these cases, the threat actors are using technology to perpetrate their attacks and hide their activities and movement, both physical and virtual, inside DoD, commercial, and Internet Access Provider (IAP) networks. Enterprise-sized networks present challenges in terms of both their size and distributed structure. Today’s state-of-the-art commercial tools do not directly address the scale and speed needed to provide the best defense for multiple networks. Networks lack robust mechanisms to collect, share, and respond to threat intelligence. Data required to detect and characterize malicious activities may be diffused and may be located across network and endpoint devices. Further, cyber-relevant data (including data that may contain information useful for detection and characterization) routinely exceeds total available storage, bandwidth, and analysis capability, often by several orders of magnitude. Of data that is able to be stored, only some is currently analyzed, and of all alerts generated, only a fraction are threat related. Storage and processing limitations abound, so cyber defenders require tools that strategically direct resources toward the data that actually contains information about threats. Current commercially available tools may output thousands of alerts and false positives per day that often cannot be verified due to a lack of processing capacity. Static data retention policies sometimes result in the deletion of relevant data prior to investigation. Additionally, current tools may neither proactively detect novel attack vectors nor detect coordinated attacks distributed across multiple organizations. Traditionally, cyber defense technologies focus predominantly upon either host data or network data. Malicious activity, however, crosscuts networks and hosts. Real-time detection of threats within or across very large enterprise networks is not simply an issue of scale, but also a challenge due to the variable nature of malicious activities and their presentations. The CHASE program seeks to develop automated tools to detect and characterize novel attack vectors, collect the right contextual data, and disseminate protective measures both within and across enterprises. CHASE aims to prototype components that enable network owners to reconfigure sensors and disseminate protective measures at machine speed with appropriate levels of human supervision. CHASE technologies will explore real-time investigations of potential cyber threats through adaptive data collection. Threat detection algorithms developed under CHASE may be tailored to characterize and react to specific classes of threats in the context of different data types and data sources. Additionally, these algorithms may work in concert to determine probabilities of the reality of threats, as well as indicate requirements for additional data that should be collected. As such, the goal of CHASE is to develop foundational technologies for detection, characterization, and strategic data management. Enhanced threat detection may cue the generation of automated protective measures. CHASE will focus on protective measures that a network owner has the authority to execute within their own environment, as well as measuring the accuracy and efficiency of threat detection techniques.   |/program/enhanced-attribution.html,Enhanced Attribution ;/staff/mr-tejas-patel.html,Mr. Tejas Patel;/news-events/artificial-intelligence-colloquium.html,Artificial Intelligence Colloquium;/news-events/hierarchical-identify-verify-exploit-proposers-day.html,Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) Proposers Day;/news-events/knowledge-management-at-scale-and-speed-proposers-day.html,Knowledge Management at Scale and Speed (KMASS) Proposers Day

The benefits of FHE are significant, from enabling the use of untrusted networks to enhancing data privacy. Despite its potential, FHE requires enormous computation time to perform even simple operations, making it exceedingly impractical to implement with traditional processing hardware. The Data Protection in Virtual Environments (DPRIVE) program seeks to enable FHE computation within a factor of ten of unencrypted computations, enabling data security for all states of data across DoD and commercial applications.While a number of FHE solutions have been developed, running FHE in software on standard processing hardware remains untenable for practical data security applications due to the massive processing overhead. DPRIVE aims to design and develop a hardware accelerator integrating novel architectural approaches, hardware, and software to dramatically reduce the processing overhead required to implement FHE calculations. Specifically, the program seeks to develop novel approaches to memory management, flexible data structures and programming models, and formal verification methods that ensure the design of the FHE implementation is effective and accurate, while also dramatically decreasing the overhead penalty required for FHE computations. The target accelerator should reduce the computational run time overhead by many orders of magnitude compared to current software-based FHE computations on conventional CPUs, and accelerate FHE calculations to within one order of magnitude of current performance on unencrypted data.|/news-events/hierarchical-identify-verify-exploit-proposers-day.html,Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) Proposers Day;/news-events/systematizing-confidence-in-open-research-and-evidence-proposers-day.html,Systematizing Confidence in Open Research and Evidence (SCORE) Proposers Day;/news-events/2020-05-06.html,Researchers on DARPA’s Brandeis Program Enhance Privacy Protections for Android Applications;/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;/news-events/2017-03-23.html,Turning to Chemistry for New “Computing” Concepts

Today, construction of complex empirical models is largely a manual process requiring a team of subject matter experts and data scientists. With ever more data becoming available via improved sensing and open sources, the opportunity exists to build models to speed scientific discovery, enhance Department of Defense/Intelligence Community’s intelligence, and improve United States Government logistics and workforce management, but capitalizing on this opportunity is fundamentally limited by the availability of data scientists.The Data-Driven Discovery of Models (D3M) program aims to develop automated model discovery systems that enable users with subject matter expertise but no data science background to create empirical models of real, complex processes. This capability will enable subject matter experts to create empirical models without the need for data scientists, and will increase the productivity of expert data scientists via automation. The D3M automated model discovery process, depicted in the figure, will be enabled by three key technologies to be developed in the course of the program: A library of selectable primitives. A discoverable archive of data modeling primitives will be developed to serve as the basic building blocks for complex modeling pipelines. Automated composition of complex models.

Moving larger payloads into farther locations in cislunar space – the volume of space between the Earth and the Moon – will require a leap-ahead in propulsion technology.The goal of the Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO) program is to demonstrate a nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) in orbit. NTRs use a nuclear reactor to heat propellant to extreme temperatures before exhausting the hot propellant through a nozzle to produce thrust. Compared to conventional space propulsion technologies, NTRs offers a high thrust-to-weight ratio around 10,000 times greater than electric propulsion and two-to-five times greater specific impulse (i.e. propellant efficiency) than in-space chemical propulsion.Phase 1 of the DRACO program involved two tracks. Track A conducted a baseline design of an NTR reactor. Track B developed an operational system concept to meet operational mission objectives and a demonstration system design that is traceable to the operational system but focuses on demonstrating the propulsion subsystem. Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the DRACO program will carry a single performer forward to the flight demonstration, which is envisioned to take place by FY27. This performer will be responsible for building the NTR and its demonstration system stage. Phase 2 will involve a cold flow test of the rocket engine without nuclear fuel. Phase 3 will involve assembly of the fueled NTR with the stage, environmental testing, and launch into space to conduct experiments on the NTR and its reactor.  |/news-events/confers-proposers-day.html,CONFERS Proposers Day;/news-events/darpa-launch-challenge.html,DARPA Launch Challenge;/news-events/darpa-launch-challenge-competitors-day.html,DARPA Launch Challenge Competitors Day;/news-events/draco-proposers-day.html,DRACO Proposers Day;/news-events/global-satellite-servicing-forum.html,Global Satellite Servicing Forum

State of the art diagnostic and biosurveillance systems are unable to keep pace with disease outbreaks and fail to support decision-making at the time and place of need. The “Detect It with Gene Editing Technologies” (DIGET) program aims to leverage advances in gene editing technologies to develop field-forward diagnostic and biosurveillance technologies that enable detection of any threat, anytime, anywhere.  To achieve its goal, DIGET performers will design, develop, prototype, and deploy two novel nucleic acid detection devices: 1) a disposable point-of-need diagnostic for up to 10 pathogens and host biomarkers, and 2) a massively multiplexed detection (MMD) device for 1,000 or more targets. Both devices must be simple to operate, low-cost, and rapidly reconfigurable to provide high-impact, high-quality, and trusted information that enhances decision-making. If successful, the disposable point-of-need device will improve the speed and efficacy of triage and treatment and enhance the standard of care for the military and public health domains in austere environments. The MMD device will enable early threat detection, assess disease severity, and improve situational awareness. The MMD platform will also provide actionable data for biosurveillance efforts such as characterization of known and emergent pathogens in circulation to inform countermeasure deployment. |/news-events/breakthrough-biological-technologies-for-national-security.html,Breakthrough Biological Technologies for National Security;/work-with-us/detect-novel-threats-and-protect-force-readiness.html,Detect Novel Threats and Protect Force Readiness ;/work-with-us/operational-biotechnology-for-mission-success.html,Operational Biotechnology for Mission Success;/work-with-us/physiological-interventions-to=maintain-operational-advantage.html,Physiological Interventions to Maintain Operational Advantage ;/work-with-us/warfighter-performance.html,Warfighter Performance

The target DRBE environment will enable numerous RF systems to interact with each other in a fully closed-loop RF arena, replicating dense, responsive, real-world RF environments. RF systems increasingly use artificial intelligence (AI) to help automate and augment capabilities for defense use. To help address the rigorous demands of testing and training these AI-enabled systems 24/7/365, virtual simulators are needed. In other domains, such as training modern fighter aircraft pilots, simulators are already in use to augment real-world aircraft flight hours. Current simulated environments, however, rely on conventional computing that is incapable of generating the computational throughput and speed to accurately replicate real-world RF interactions, model the scale of physical test ranges, or meet the technical requirements of more complex systems. DRBE is exploring novel computing architectures to enable the creation of a new breed of High Performance Computing (HPC) – dubbed “Real Time HPC” or RT-HPC. The goal of the RT-HPC is to generate computational performance in the double-digit petaFLOPs class while maintaining single-digit microsecond scale end-to-end latency. By balancing computational throughput with extreme low latency, DRBE should be capable of generating high-fidelity RF environments. To support the creation of RT-HPC and the virtual RF test range, DRBE will: 1) develop novel processors and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that realize the low-latency, high compute capacity vision; 2) assemble these ASICs into a multi-processor RT-HPC system; and 3) design and integrate the necessary tools to demonstrate the use of the RT-HPC as a large-scale virtual RF test range.  |/news-events/eri-summit-mto-symposium.html,2020 DARPA ERI Summit & MTO Symposium;/news-events/electronics-resurgence-initiative-summit-2019.html,Electronics Resurgence Initiative (ERI) Summit 2019;/news-events/hierarchical-identify-verify-exploit-proposers-day.html,Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) Proposers Day;/news-events/microsystems-technology-office-proposers-day.html,Microsystems Technology Office Proposers Day;/news-events/2016-08-19.html,Microsystems Technology Office to host Office-Wide Proposers Day

That early development ushered in a new era for microwave technology, transformed modern warfare, and has since been enabling a multitude of Department of Defense (DoD) and civilian capabilities, including radar, navigation technologies, and satellite and terrestrial communications. Extending frequency control to the optical regime is anticipated to greatly extend the technology base for the next generation of warfighter and other capabilities. Since the first demonstration of optical frequency synthesis using self-referenced optical combs in 2000, demonstrations of novel civilian and defense applications for the technology have emerged worldwide. Due to the large size, relative fragility, and high cost of these components and systems, however, precise optical frequency synthesis has been limited to lab-scale experiments. DODOS aims to leverage recent breakthroughs in chip-scale mode-locked lasers and microresonators to enable self-referenced optical frequency combs in compact integrated packages. The program proposes to draw on recent progress in heterogeneous photonic integration to arrange all of the necessary components, including widely tunable laser sources, optical modulators, non-linear photonic elements, and CMOS radiofrequency (RF) and control circuitry onto a chip with a volume of less than 1 cm^3 and power consumption of less than 1 Watt. The DODOS chip will act as a gearbox to directly translate the stability and accuracy of an RF signal to the optical domain, producing laser light at frequencies above 200 terahertz with relative accuracy of one part in 10^15. New generations of optical frequency control technology could enable a wide range of applications in optical spectroscopy, gas sensing, LiDAR, portable atomic clocks, high-bandwidth and secure communications, and intrusion detection, among other areas. The DODOS program also aims to spur research in octave-spanning microcombs, high-efficiency chip-scale lasers, high-efficiency on-chip frequency doubling, and CMOS-compatible integration technology.  |/news-events/2018-04-25.html,Achieving Unprecedented Frequency Control in Miniature Lasers ;/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;/news-events/lasers-for-universal-microscale-optical-systems-proposers-day.html,Lasers for Universal Microscale Optical Systems (LUMOS) Proposers Day;/news-events/photonics-in-the-package-for-extreme-scalability-proposers-day.html,Photonics in the Package for Extreme Scalability (PIPES) Proposers Day;/news-events/2021-10-12.html,Episode 50: The Photonicist

As this trajectory shows signs of slowing, however, it has become increasingly more challenging to achieve performance gains from generalized hardware, setting the stage for a resurgence in specialized architectures. Today’s specialized, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) — hardware customized for a specific application — offer limited flexibility and are costly to design, fabricate, and program. The Domain-Specific System on Chip (DSSoC) program seeks to prove that there need not be a continued tradeoff between efficiency, like that found in ASICs, and flexibility, the hallmark of general-purpose processors. The goal of DSSoC is to develop a heterogeneous system-on-chip (SoC) comprised of many cores that mix general purpose processors, special purpose processors, hardware accelerators, memory, and input/output (I/O) devices to significantly improve performance of applications within a domain. A domain is larger than any one application, where one processor can effectively address problems more efficiently than a general purpose processor but without the challenge, time, and cost of building a special-purpose system like an ASIC.  DSSoC is exploring architectures that improve the efficiency of computing through specialized processing while maintaining programmability. To better support the large and growing range of applications needed by the Department of Defense (DoD) to maintain its technological advantage the DSSoC program will seek to produce concepts that provide improved computing efficiency for embedded processing needs while making these systems more programmable. To do this, DSSoC will address critical issues in today’s development cycle that force low-level engineering to port applications onto the specifics of the underlying processors. Specifically, the DSSoC program will seek to develop software stacks that enable better hardware-software co-design by providing vertical integration of tools from the hardware up to the development environment. A second key impact of DSSoC will be the development of intelligent scheduling of applications and data on a heterogeneous processor to make better use of the heterogeneity and parallelism of these systems, whereas today, programming applications for complex systems is a time-consuming, hand-tuned exercise. |/news-events/electronics-resurgence-initiative-summit.html,Electronics Resurgence Initiative Summit;/news-events/2021-12-22.html,DARPA Joins Public-Private Partnership to Address Challenges Facing Microelectronics Advancement;/news-events/2020-06-17.html,DARPA Announces Third-Annual Electronics Resurgence Initiative Summit & MTO Symposium;/news-events/2019-05-31.html,DARPA Announces ERI Summit 2019 Workshops;/news-events/2019-04-05.html,DARPA Announces Second Annual ERI Summit

DRINQS aims to investigate this phenomenon and demonstrate significant gains over conventional states in timekeeping, field sensing, and information processing for use in national security applications.The performance of quantum sensors and devices is intimately dependent on its coherence, which is the length of time the underlying system retains its quantum properties before environmental interactions make the state behave like a conventional classical system. The interactions of atoms within the system and with a “noisy” thermal environment are typically limiting factors of coherence time, which means the best quantum devices require extremely clean control signals and cryogenic environments to reduce thermal disturbances. This requirement for pristine laboratory conditions to maintain coherence has limited the applicability and adoption of quantum technology in operational devices of interest to national security, such as mobile high-performance atomic clocks that could provide troops GPS-like precision navigation in GPS-denied environments. DRINQS aims to determine and demonstrate what protocols can optimally enhance quantum coherence in driven systems. Additionally, the program plans to demonstrate a proof-of-principle with 10X improvement over conventional techniques in clock stability, high spatial resolution field sensing, and quantum information applications. |/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;/news-events/eri-summit-mto-symposium.html,2020 DARPA ERI Summit & MTO Symposium;/news-events/angler-proposers-day.html,Angler Proposers Day;/news-events/dso-proposers-day.html,Defense Sciences Office Proposers Day;/news-events/discover-dso-day.html,Discover DSO Day

ElectRx seeks to deliver non-pharmacological treatments for pain, general inflammation, post-traumatic stress, severe anxiety, and trauma that employ precise, closed-loop, non-invasive modulation of the patient’s peripheral nervous system. The human nervous system already plays a vital role in maintaining all aspects of physical and mental health. A sophisticated network of sensory nerves continuously monitors health status and triggers reflexive responses in the brain and spinal cord when an infection or injury is detected. These reflexes normally adjust organ function to initiate and control the healing process. However, some diseases can disrupt healthy functioning of these processes and produce nerve signaling that causes pain, metabolic disorders such as diabetes, and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. ElectRx technology would exploit and supplement the body’s natural ability to quickly and effectively heal itself, intervening when required to correct or bolster nervous system activity. ElectRx is establishing the underlying science and developing the technologies that could enable artificial modulation of peripheral nerves to restore healthy patterns of signaling in these neural circuits. The program seeks to advance understanding of the anatomy and physiology of specific neural circuits and their role in health and disease. In parallel, the program also seeks to develop novel biological-interface technologies for monitoring biomarkers and peripheral nerve activity, and delivering therapeutic signals to peripheral nerve targets. Potential new approaches include in vivo, real-time biosensors and novel neural interfaces using optical, acoustic, electromagnetic, or engineered biology strategies to achieve precise targeting with potentially single-axon resolution.Following successes in early proof-of-concept studies, the ElectRx devices and therapeutic systems under development are entering into clinical studies. If successful, such precise neuromodulation capability technology would reduce dependence on traditional drugs and create new treatments that could be automatically and continuously tuned to the needs of warfighters without side effects. The technology could also help doctors evaluate and predict various physiological states, and characterize host response in patients with severe infections, providing a quantitative framework to guide operations and therapy.     |/news-events/2022-04-04.html,Episode 55: Sensorized Prosthetics;/news-events/2019-10-17.html,New Generation of Intelligent Bio-Interfaces Could Overcome Aspects of Spinal Cord Injury;/news-events/2015-10-05.html,Work Begins to Support Self-Healing of Body and Mind;/news-events/2015-02-08.html,HAPTIX Starts Work to Provide Prosthetic Hands with Sense of Touch;/program/hand-proprioception-and-touch-interfaces.html,Hand Proprioception and Touch Interfaces

Moreover, the efficiency of today’s G-band electronics is poor and must be addressed to make G-band systems viable.As has been the case for communications at lower frequencies, phased arrays and massive multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) systems are the preferred implementation solution for millimeter-wave systems. G-band arrays can be implemented using either silicon-based (e.g., CMOS, SiGe) RF integrated circuits (ICs) or III-V compound semiconductor (e.g., GaAs, GaN, InP) monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs). Each approach has advantages – but also limitations.The ELectronics for G-band ARrays (ELGAR) seeks to develop integration technologies needed to create compact, high-performance III-V RF electronics to enable communication and sensing systems at G-band frequencies. These integration technologies will combine the superior RF performance of III-V RF electronics with the advanced interconnect features of silicon-based technology. The ELGAR program will leverage this approach to demonstrate compact, high-efficiency power amplifier (PA) MMICs and efficient, transmit and receive array front-end test articles that operate at 220 GHz.To achieve its objectives, ELGAR will focus on two technical challenges. The first challenge addresses efficiency concerns at the MMIC level. The program seeks to develop compact, high-efficiency G-band MMICs – moving from less than 10% efficiency to more than 30% efficiency. The second challenge is achieving low-loss off-chip interconnects between adjacent G-band array components. Performers will then integrate the ELGAR MMICs into compact, efficient 16-element transmit and receive arrays.  |/news-events/2018-01-24.html,DARPA Seeks to Improve Military Communications with  Digital Phased-Arrays at Millimeter Wave;/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;/news-events/2017-03-30.html,Battle of the ModRecs Lays Groundwork for Improved Spectrum Management  ;/news-events/2016-06-16a.html,Finessing Miniaturized Magnetics into the Microelectronics Mix;/news-events/2014-10-28.html,DARPA Circuit Achieves Speeds of 1 Trillion Cycles per Second, Earns Guinness World Record

The DARPA ENVision program will leverage recent advances in planar optics and transduction materials to develop novel direct-view NV systems that demonstrate an increased FOV and enhanced visual access across infrared bands, all contained in a low-torque eyeglass form factor. ENVision will also investigate the fundamental limits of low-input-intensity photon upconversion bandwidth and efficiency. These new insights could potentially lead to further transformative NV systems that require no optics or transduction, but simply directly upconvert ambient infrared light into the visible.  |/news-events/2022-01-12a.html,DARPA Selects Teams to Develop Lightweight, Enhanced Night Vision Goggles;/news-events/2021-01-07a.html,Night-Vision Revolution: Less Weight, Improved Performance;/news-events/enabling-night-vision-in-eyeglass-form-factors-proposers-day.html,Enabling Night Vision in eyeglass form factors (ENVision) Proposers Day;/news-events/2023-03-22.html,Breaking the One Part-One Material Paradigm;/news-events/2022-08-16a.html,Work Begins on Next Generation of Battlefield Obscurants

EDGE seeks design capabilities that will be fast, quantifiable, and repeatable enough for effective HMI concept design, development, and testing to be integrated into the larger systems design and development process. HMI design has not matured at the same pace as automated and autonomous machines and, as a result, most current interfaces do a poor job supporting the operator’s SA of the machine’s processes, status, and/or operational context. An operator with reduced SA may not adapt to unexpected circumstances, risking catastrophic failure.EDGE aims to create HMI design tools prioritized and oriented toward quantifying, supporting, and testing SA, rather than reducing cognitive load at the expense of SA. EDGE will help designers build HMI systems that allow operators to not just monitor autonomous systems but also adapt their use to meet the needs of unanticipated situations. |/news-events/enhancing-design-through-graceful-extensibility-proposers-day.html,Enhancing Design through Graceful Extensibility (EDGE) Proposers Day;/news-events/2021-05-21.html,Enabling Human Control of Autonomous Partners;/news-events/subt-cave-circuit-virtual-competition.html,DARPA Subterranean (SubT) Challenge Cave Circuit Virtual Competition;/news-events/2021-09-24a.html,Team CERBERUS and Team Dynamo Win DARPA Subterranean Challenge Final Event;/news-events/2021-08-12.html,Stage is Set for DARPA’s Subterranean Challenge Final Event

To do this, the program is building a man-portable device that analyzes an individual’s epigenetic “fingerprint” to potentially reveal a detailed history of that individual’s exposure to WMD or their precursors. DARPA envisions that the same technology could provide rapid diagnostics for troops who may have been exposed to threat agents or who may be suffering from infections, providing a timely signal to apply effective medical countermeasures.ECHO technology would work by quickly reading an individual’s epigenome — a part of human biology that helps our body respond to the constantly changing world around us — and identifying the epigenetic signatures indicative of WMD, precursor, or infectious disease exposure. Though a person’s underlying genetic code is stable, life events can leave discernible marks on the genome that modify how genes are expressed. The epigenome is the combination of all such natural modifications, and while epigenetic modifications can register within seconds to minutes, they can potentially imprint the genome for decades, leaving a unique, time-stamped biography of an individual’s exposures. The ECHO system would read someone’s epigenome from a biological sample such as a finger prick or nasal swab, and conduct analysis to reveal possible exposure events even when other physical evidence has been erased. ECHO technology would offer an enormous advantage over state-of-the-art forensic and diagnostic screening technologies as it will identify the type of exposure and when it occurred — all without the need for trace amounts of the threat in the sample. Program performers will develop new approaches to identifying and characterizing epigenetic signatures from WMD, precursor, or infectious disease exposure events, and create new bioinformatics tools to perform forensic analyses with high sensitivity, specificity, and temporal resolution. They will have to create a device capable of performing multiple molecular analyses and onboard bioinformatics in 30 minutes or less, compared to an average of two days using current laboratory processes. By the end of the program, DARPA’s plans to demonstrate ECHO capabilities in a man-portable device that could be used by an operator in austere settings with only minimal training. |/news-events/epigenetic-characterization-and-observation-proposers-day.html,Epigenetic CHaracterization and Observation (ECHO) Proposers Day;/news-events/2021-10-28.html,WMD Threat Sensors Integrated, Tested in Police Vehicles;/news-events/2020-10-21.html,Indianapolis Testing Advances Capabilities of Chemical, Biological Threat Detection Sensors ;/news-events/2018-02-01.html,Reading the Body’s History of Threat Exposure;/program/sigma-plus.html,SIGMA+

The FENCE FPA could solve the problems of timing accuracy and data sparsity to produce an infrared event-based neuromorphic imager consistent with military requirements. The FENCE FPA will consist of a low latency, high precision event-based readout matched to low power embedded neuromorphic processing capable of executing algorithms that use combined spatial and temporal (spatio-temporal) information, to produce a new intelligent sensor for tactical DoD applications. The sole technical area is focused on the development of an asynchronous read-out integrated circuit (ROIC) capable of very low latency and power operation and a low power processing layer that integrates with the ROIC to identify salient spatio-temporal signals. The goal is to integrate the ROIC and the processing layer together to demonstrate a FENCE sensor operating at low power (< 1.5 W).  |/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;/news-events/electronics-resurgence-initiative-summit.html,Electronics Resurgence Initiative Summit;/news-events/hierarchical-identify-verify-exploit-proposers-day.html,Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) Proposers Day;/news-events/invisible-headlights-proposers-day.html,Invisible Headlights Proposers Day;/news-events/military-invention-day-at-the-smithsonian-2018.html,Military Invention Day at the Smithsonian

Each of these strategies has significant limitations that hinder use, notably effectiveness, time-to-therapeutic onset, and/or invasiveness. There is a pressing need for fast-acting and safe therapeutics that can be administered acutely to mitigate the deleterious consequences of neuropsychiatric illness. The Focused Pharma program seeks to develop novel drugs with broad-spectrum therapeutic activity and rapid onset of effect for treating a range of neuropsychiatric conditions of high need within the Department of Defense. The program supports research in medicinal chemistry and neuropharmacology to develop novel drugs that specifically engage select neurotransmitter receptor subtypes and demonstrate downstream signaling pathway bias.

FS2 will conduct research to test the feasibility of applying this approach for defense of cereal crops, specifically rice and corn.FS2 will use rust fungi as a program test case. Rice is not susceptible to fungal rust pathogens; however, many other important cereal crops are, including corn. Despite this type of phenotypic variation between cereal species, many key genetic and biochemical pathways are widely conserved across members of the grass family. Because of their economic impact, cereal rust diseases are monitored using plant and field-level data during the growing season through snapshot Agriculture Department surveys, and are scouted via cultivation and harvest equipment, drones, smartphones, and other devices with cameras or sensors. FS2 aims to develop validated models to systematically identify earliest observable features of key damage pathways irrespective of the activating agent.FS2 is part of DARPA’s Disruptioneering effort designed to rapidly explore bold and risky ideas with the goal of accelerating scientific discovery. The 18-month FS2 program comprises two phases. The 10-month first phase addresses genetic modeling with the goal of demonstrating that it is possible to link plant-level observable variation via actual and inferred pathways in corn. A second, eight-month phase aims to demonstrate whether it is possible to build a candidate explanatory pathways model that can link adverse plant-level observations of unknown origin in corn to candidate explanatory pathways. FS2 Disruption Opportunity&amp;amp;nbsp; DARPA DSO Overview&amp;amp;nbsp;|/news-events/dso-proposers-day.html,Defense Sciences Office Proposers Day;/news-events/discover-dso-day.html,Discover DSO Day;/news-events/discover-dso-day-2021.html,Discover DSO Day;/news-events/discover-dso-day-d3.html,Discover DSO Day (D3);/news-events/2022-10-05.html,DARPA Seeks Innovators to Accelerate Pace of Scientific Discovery

The goal of the program is to quickly determine whether an unknown bacterium is harmless or virulent by directly identifying pathogenic behavior, avoiding conventional strategies that rely on known biomarkers.The risk posed by unknown bacteria is increasing as the global environment changes, populations expand, and tools for genetic engineering proliferate. After new pathogens emerge, they can easily spread due to increased global travel among dense urban centers. Any one of these unfamiliar strains might pose a health risk to deployed service members—especially among first responders to outbreaks of infectious disease. Current biosurveillance strategies based on biochemical markers fall short in identifying potentially harmful bacteria since they do not work on undiscovered bacterial strains or on bacteria engineered to evade detection. To overcome this problem, Friend or Foe aims to characterize bacteria by identifying pathogenic behavior itself. The envisioned, high-throughput Friend or Foe platform seeks to screen many unfamiliar strains of bacteria at once to reveal their phenotypes, first by extracting and isolating bacteria from complex environmental samples, then by sustaining them in simulated host organism environments, and finally by interrogating the bacteria to determine pathogenicity. In effect, the systems will play the biological equivalent of the game “Twenty Questions,” subjecting bacteria to a battery of physical and chemical tests to determine pathogenicity.This screening would flag dangerous bacteria for subsequent genetic sequencing to map the newly discovered pathogenic traits to specific genes. Early identification of pathogenic genes could accelerate research into the development of therapeutic countermeasures or provide new assays for more conventional, front-line biosurveillance and diagnostic platforms.  |/news-events/friend-or-foe-proposers-day.html,Friend or Foe Proposers Day;/news-events/2018-02-07a.html,Playing 20 Questions with Bacteria to Distinguish Harmless Organisms from Pathogens;/news-events/grit-proposers-day-webinar.html,GRIT Proposers Day Webinar;/news-events/2023-02-15.html,DARPA RPM Aims to Speed-Up Production of On-Demand Protein-Based Therapeutics;/news-events/2021-10-28.html,WMD Threat Sensors Integrated, Tested in Police Vehicles

Current propulsion technologies (e.g. conventional rockets, ramjets, and gas-turbine engines) have limitations in maximum range, speed, and/or affordability that hinders their ability to meet the Gambit program objectives. RDEs are more compact than conventional ramjets, which allows them to carry more fuel. Additionally, RDEs are less complex than gas turbine engines. The combination of these two factors enable RDEs to affordably meet the Gambit program objectives.Gambit will develop and demonstrate RDE technology in a full-scale freejet test. Phase 1 focuses on preliminary design of the freejet test article and substantiating the design with combustor and inlet testing. Phase 2 focuses on detailed design, fabrication, and testing of the freejet test article.

These impairments, broadly quantified as phase noise, ultimately limit the performance of many military and commercial RF systems.The Generating RF with Photonic Oscillators for Low Noise (GRYPHON) program seeks to develop compact microwave frequency oscillators with extremely low phase noise to enable advanced sensing and communication applications. In the last decade, major advances in oscillator performance have been realized using optical techniques to synthesize high-fidelity microwave signals. Such oscillators employ optical frequency division to reach world-record phase noise levels. The solutions demonstrated to date, however, have sacrificed other important attributes in pursuit of spectral purity. Such trade-offs are problematic, because module size, cost, tunability, and environmental sensitivity are also critical factors that determine the applicability of microwave sources to commercial and military systems. GRYPHON will leverage recent developments in nonlinear photonics and photonic-electronic integration to develop microwave sources with noise performance that meets or exceeds that of the best discrete oscillator modules, yet occupy a compact volume typical of far noisier chip-scale voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs). Moreover, by program end, GRYPHON microwave sources will operate as synthesizers with the ability to tune to any frequency from 1 to 40+ GHz during operation. This combination of features is unprecedented in today’s state of the art, and will establish a new regime of source technology that is expected to transform the types and capabilities of military and commercial radar and communication systems. |/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;/news-events/microsystems-technology-office-proposers-day.html,Microsystems Technology Office Proposers Day;/news-events/2016-08-19.html,Microsystems Technology Office to host Office-Wide Proposers Day;/work-with-us/microsystems-exploration.html,Microsystems Exploration;/about-us/offices/mto/more.html,Microsystems Technology Office

Grounded Artificial Intelligence Language Acquisition (GAILA) |The past few decades have seen explosive growth in the development and training of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, which are now embedded in digital computing processes spanning several key industries.|https://www.darpa.mil/JSON/program/grounded-artificial-intelligence-language-acquisition.json|I2O|Dr. Wil Corvey|/staff/dr-wil-corvey.html|Artificial Intelligence,Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Symbiosis Technologies,/tag-list.html?tag=Artificial Intelligence;Language,Language Technology,/tag-list.html?tag=Language|The past few decades have seen explosive growth in the development and training of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, which are now embedded in digital computing processes spanning several key industries. One area that has benefited from AI, and specifically machine learning (ML) techniques and statistical methods, is the area of human language technology (HLT). These methods have provided significant improvements to numerous language technologies such as machine translation, information retrieval, name entity detection, event detection, knowledge base creation, and more. These technologies have been successfully deployed in government, defense, and commercial settings, such as for call centers, reservation services, and personal assistants.However, ML suffers from a need for large amounts of annotated data for training in order to achieve the required accuracy for various applications. ML technology is also brittle, incapable of dealing with new data sources, topics, media, and vocabularies. These weaknesses of ML, as applied to natural language, are due to exclusive reliance on the statistical aspects of language, with no regard for its meaning.The Grounded Artificial Intelligence Language Acquisition (GAILA) AI Exploration (AIE) topic aims to enable computers to acquire language in a manner similar to the way children do. Children acquire language based on their perceptions of aural and visual information about the world around them. The process of observing moving images and aligning them with auditory stimuli allows them to associate a sequence of sounds (a word) with some aspect of the concrete or abstract elements of the world that the word represents. Children learn to decipher which aspects of an observed scenario relate to the different words in the message from a tiny fraction of the examples that ML systems require. Sequencing information, variations of word forms, and other additional information help children make ever finer classifications of the concepts that they learn, about events or actions (often expressed by verbs), the objects or entities that participate in those events (typically nouns), and the attributes and relations of those entities and events (adjectives and prepositional phrases). GAILA seeks to research and develop a model for grounded language acquisition and an automated language acquisition prototype that learns to understand English text and speech, making the information more useable by automated analytics. |/news-events/influence-campaign-awareness-and-sensemaking.html,INfluence Campaign Awareness and Sensemaking (INCAS);/news-events/knowlege-directed-artificial-intelligence-reasoning-over-schemas-proposers-day.html,Knowledge-directed Artificial Intelligence Reasoning Over Schemas (KAIROS) Proposers Day;/news-events/2022-11-17.html,Episode 62: The Model (& Simulation) Researcher;/news-events/2022-06-16.html,Voices from DARPA Podcast Episode 57: Unmasking Misinformation & Manipulation;/news-events/2021-09-02.html,DARPA Announces Researchers Selected to INCAS Program

In certain places, the Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial industry have adopted a series of air-gaps – or breaks between computing systems – to prevent the leakage and compromise of sensitive information. However, the use of air-gaps does not address the DoD’s need for fusion of data across systems of different levels to support defense operations. Similarly, the increasing use of cloud architectures demands better solutions for data privacy in commercial computing systems.The Guaranteed Architectures for Physical Security (GAPS) program seeks to reduce inherent system complexity through the development of hardware and software that is open, extendible, and compatible with Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constrained environments to enable security across DoD and commercial systems. The goal of the GAPS program is to develop hardware security and software architectures with provable security interfaces, which physically isolate high-risk transactions during system design and system build, and track that such protections are physically enforced at run-time. GAPS aims to substantially lower the barrier to safely enable high-risk transactions, thus allowing for: a) faster computer to computer transactions; b) spatial isolation reducing the need for insufficient software partitioning solutions (i.e. hypervisors); and c) more complex missions without putting sensitive data at risk.  |/news-events/hardening-development-toolchains-against-emergent-execution-engines-proposers-day.html,Hardening Development Toolchains Against Emergent Execution Engines (HARDEN) Proposers Day;/news-events/2022-10-13.html,DARPA Selects Teams to Protect Computers’ ‘Roots of Trust’ from Exploits;/news-events/2021-09-22.html,Disrupting Exploitable Patterns in Software to Make Systems Safer;/news-events/ursa-proposers-day.html,URSA Proposers Day;/news-events/v-spells-proposers-day.html,Verified Security and Performance Enhancement of Large Legacy Software (V-SPELLS) Proposers Day

Current research on adversarial AI focuses on approaches where imperceptible perturbations to ML inputs could deceive an ML classifier, altering its response. Such results have initiated a rapidly proliferating field of research characterized by ever more complex attacks that require progressively less knowledge about the ML system being attacked, while proving increasingly strong against defensive countermeasures. Although the field of adversarial AI is relatively young, dozens of attacks and defenses have already been proposed, and at present a comprehensive theoretical understanding of ML vulnerabilities is lacking. GARD seeks to establish theoretical ML system foundations to identify system vulnerabilities, characterize properties that will enhance system robustness, and encourage the creation of effective defenses. Currently, ML defenses tend to be highly specific and are effective only against particular attacks. GARD seeks to develop defenses capable of defending against broad categories of attacks. Furthermore, current evaluation paradigms of AI robustness often focus on simplistic measures that may not be relevant to security. To verify relevance to security and wide applicability, defenses generated under GARD will be measured in a novel testbed employing scenario-based evaluations. As part of the program, GARD researchers from Two Six Technologies, IBM, MITRE, University of Chicago, and Google Research generated the following virtual testbed, toolbox, benchmarking dataset, and training materials that are now available to broader research community:The Armory virtual platform, available on GitHub, serves as a “testbed” for researchers in need of repeatable, scalable, and robust evaluations of adversarial defenses.Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) provides tools for developers and researchers to defend and evaluate their ML models and applications against a number of adversarial threats.The Adversarial Patches Rearranged In COnText (APRICOT) dataset enables reproducible research on the real-world effectiveness of physical adversarial patch attacks on object detection systems.The Google Research Self-Study repository contains “test dummies” that represent a common idea or approach to build defenses.The GARD program’s Holistic Evaluation of Adversarial Defenses repository is available at https://www.gardproject.org/. Interested researchers are encouraged to take advantage of these resources and check back often for updates. |/news-events/2021-12-21.html,DARPA Open Sources Resources to Aid Evaluation of Adversarial AI Defenses;/news-events/2020-09-23.html,Episode 33: The Verification Virtuoso;/news-events/2019-02-06.html,Defending Against Adversarial Artificial Intelligence;/program/reverse-engineering-of-deceptions.html,Reverse Engineering of Deceptions;/about-us/offices/i2o.html,Information Innovation Office

Today, GPS denial is the most significant tactical challenge to secure positioning, navigation and timing. H6 is the spiritual successor to Harrison’s H5, aiming to eliminate GPS-timing dependency while maintaining signal assurance, pervasive security, and high-bandwidth communications.

If successful, the resulting system would provide users near-natural control of prosthetic hands and arms via bi-directional peripheral nerve implants. The program has a strong focus on technology handoff and aims to create and transition clinically relevant technology in support of wounded warriors suffering from single or multiple limb loss.  HAPTIX builds on prior DARPA investments in the Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program, which created novel neural interface systems that overcame previous sensor reliability issues to now last for the lifetime of the patient. A key focus of HAPTIX is on creating new technologies to interface permanently and continuously with the peripheral nerves in humans. HAPTIX technologies are being designed to tap into the motor and sensory signals of the arm to allow users to control and sense the prosthesis via the same neural signaling pathways used for intact limbs. Direct access to these natural control signals will, if successful, enable more natural, intuitive control of complex hand movements, and the addition of sensory feedback will further improve hand functionality by enabling users to sense grip force and hand posture. Sensory feedback may also provide important psychological benefits such as improving prosthesis “embodiment” and reducing the phantom limb pain that is suffered by approximately 80 percent of amputees.In addition to developing the low-power microelectronics needed for the system, HAPTIX performer teams also conduct fundamental neuroscience research to understand how the nervous system encodes motor and sensory information for the hand. This knowledge guides development of algorithms that enable intuitive control of the prosthesis and provide rich sensations of touch and proprioception. If successful, the completed HAPTIX system will be integrated with one of the advanced prosthetic limbs developed under DARPA’s Revolutionizing Prosthetics program to create the first dexterous prosthetic limb with full sensory and motor capabilities that is suitable for home use. DARPA anticipates a 12-month, take-home clinical trial of the complete HAPTIX system as the culmination of the program.  |/news-events/2022-11-15.html,DARPA Seeks Novel Approaches to Improve Mental Health, Prevent Suicide;/news-events/2022-04-04.html,Episode 55: Sensorized Prosthetics;/news-events/2019-10-17.html,New Generation of Intelligent Bio-Interfaces Could Overcome Aspects of Spinal Cord Injury;/news-events/2016-10-26.html,Neuroscience of Touch Supports Improved Robotic and Prosthetic Interfaces;/news-events/2015-10-05.html,Work Begins to Support Self-Healing of Body and Mind

The goal is to integrate those capabilities into the standard processes of the software development lifecycle.Additional information is available in the HARDEN Program Announcement. |/news-events/artificial-intelligence-colloquium.html,Artificial Intelligence Colloquium;/news-events/2022-11-28.html,U.S. Cyber Command, DARPA Initiate Rapid Cyber Capability Prototyping and Integration Pilot ;/news-events/2022-10-24.html,DARPA’s CASTLE to Fortify Computer Networks;/news-events/2022-07-21.html,Voices from DARPA Podcast Episode 58: The Cryptoprivacist;/news-events/2022-06-03.html,DARPA’s ANSR to Improving Trustworthy AI
Harnessing Autonomy for Countering Cyberadversary Systems (HACCS) |Malicious actors are currently able to compromise and use with impunity large numbers of devices owned and operated by third parties. Such collections of compromised and conscripted devices, commonly referred to as botnets, are used for criminal, espionage, and computer network attack purposes (often a combination of all three). Recent examples of botnets and similar malicious code include Mirai, Hidden Cobra, WannaCry, and Petya/NotPetya|https://www.darpa.mil/JSON/program/harnessing-autonomy-for-countering-cyberadversary-systems.json|I2O|Ms. Allison Kline|/staff/ms-allison-kline.html|Autonomy,Supervised Autonomy,/tag-list.html?tag=Autonomy;Cyber,Cyber,/tag-list.html?tag=Cyber|Malicious actors are currently able to compromise and use with impunity large numbers of devices owned and operated by third parties. Such collections of compromised and conscripted devices, commonly referred to as botnets, are used for criminal, espionage, and computer network attack purposes (often a combination of all three). Recent examples of botnets and similar malicious code include Mirai, Hidden Cobra, WannaCry, and Petya/NotPetya. The potential scale of their effects make such malware a national security threat. The May 11, 2017, Presidential Executive Order on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure specifically identifies botnets as a high priority national security issue. Improving the security posture of Department of Defense (DoD) networks alone is insufficient to counter such threats to national security, as the majority of botnet nodes reside in neutral networks (“gray space”). Current incident response methods are too resource- and time-consuming to address the problem at scale. Active defense methods are insufficiently precise and predictable in their behavior, posing a risk that they may cause processing issues or other side effects. What is needed is the ability to identify and neutralize botnets and other large-scale malware from compromised devices and networks in a scalable, timely, safe, and reliable manner, in accordance with appropriate privacy and other legal authorities. To achieve the necessary scale and timeliness, such a capability must be effective even if the owners of botnet conscripted networks are unaware of the infection and are not actively participating in the neutralization process.The HACCS program will investigate the feasibility of creating safe and reliable autonomous software agents that can effectively counter malicious botnet implants and similar large-scale malware. The program will do so by developing a quantitative framework and established parameters for their safe, reliable, and effective use. HACCS performers will develop the techniques and algorithms necessary to measure the accuracy of identifying botnet-infected networks, the accuracy of identifying the type of devices residing in a network, and the stability of potential access vectors. The program will take an experimental approach to verify the implementation of such autonomous agents and the rules under which they operate, and to measure the effectiveness of denying, degrading, and disrupting botnets and individual botnet implants without affecting the systems and networks on which they reside.The HACCS program seeks to:Accurately identify and fingerprint botnet-conscripted networks to determine the presence of botnet implants, the number and types of devices present on said networks, and the software services running on these devices with sufficient precision to infer the presence of known vulnerabilities (also referred to as “n-day” vulnerabilities); Generate non-disruptive software exploits for a large number of known vulnerabilities that can be used to establish initial presence in each botnet-conscripted network without affecting legitimate system functionality; andCreate high-assurance software agents that safely, reliably, and autonomously navigate within botnet-conscripted networks, identify botnet implants, and neutralize them or otherwise curtail their ability to operate, while minimizing side effects to these neutral systems and infrastructure.  |/news-events/2022-06-03.html,DARPA’s ANSR to Improving Trustworthy AI;/news-events/2017-08-16.html,DARPA Assured Autonomy Seeks to Guarantee Safety of Learning-enabled Autonomous Systems;/program/active-social-engineering-defense.html,Active Social Engineering Defense;/program/assured-neuro-symbolic-learning-and-reasoning.html,Assured Neuro Symbolic Learning and Reasoning;/staff/mr-daniel-kerr.html,Mr. Daniel R.

Furthermore, the responsibility of the DoD to protect the homeland encompasses biological threat agents, including bacterial threats, for which effective countermeasures are critical.HEALR seeks to establish an orthogonal approach to treating microbial infections by harnessing advancements in recruiting native cellular host machinery to recognize and eliminate disease-related targets. Specifically, HEALR will develop new medical countermeasures (MCMs) that result in host-driven degradation or deactivation of pathogen targets. By harnessing innate cellular processes, approaches such as proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and similar methods can achieve superior outcomes over existing therapies.HEALR aims to develop: (1) tools to target microbial pathogens for protein degradation (i.e., target-binding ligand development), (2) new protein degradation modalities to enable new pathways to protein degradation or deactivation (i.e., ‘NewTACs’), and (3) a platform that leverages these advances to permit flexible and rapid response to emerging threats. |/news-events/2021-08-06.html,DARPA Selects Teams to Develop Novel Therapeutics for Combating Multi-Drug Resistant Microbial Infections;/news-events/2020-06-12.html,DARPA Program Seeks to Develop Novel Therapeutics for Combating Microbial Infections;/news-events/advanced-acclimation-and-protection-tool-for-environmental-readiness-proposers-day.html,ADvanced Acclimation and Protection Tool for Environmental Readiness (ADAPTER) Proposers Day;/news-events/pandemic-prevention-platform-east-coast-proposers-day.html,Pandemic Prevention Platform (P3) East Coast Proposers Day;/news-events/pandemic-prevention-platform-west-coast-proposers-day.html,Pandemic Prevention Platform (P3) West Coast Proposers Day

However, understanding the relationships among this data can be challenging. Graph analytics has emerged as an approach by which analysts can efficiently examine the structure of the large networks produced from these data sources and draw conclusions from the observed patterns. By understanding the complex relationships both within and between data sources, a more complete picture of the analysis problem can be understood. With lessons learned from innovations in the expanding realm of deep neural networks, the Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) program seeks to advance the arena of graph analytics. The HIVE program is looking to build a graph analytics processor that can process streaming graphs 1000X faster and at much lower power than current processing technology. If successful, the program will enable graph analytics techniques powerful enough to solve tough challenges in cyber security, infrastructure monitoring and other areas of national interest. Graph analytic processing that currently requires racks of servers could become practical in tactical situations to support front-line decision making. What ’s more, these advanced graph analytics servers could have the power to analyze the billion- and trillion-edge graphs that will be generated by the Internet of Things, ever-expanding social networks, and future sensor networks. In parallel with the hardware development of a HIVE processor, DARPA is working with MIT Lincoln Laboratory and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host the HIVE Graph Challenge with the goal of developing a trillion-edge dataset. This freely available dataset will spur innovative software and hardware solutions in the broader graph analysis community that will contribute to the HIVE program.   The overall objective is to accelerate innovation in graph analytics to open new pathways for meeting the challenge of understanding an ever-increasing torrent of data. The HIVE program features two primary challenges:  The first is a static graph problem focused on sub-graph Isomorphism. This task is to further the ability to search a large graph in order to identify a particular subsection of that graph. The second is a dynamic graph problem focused on trying to find optimal clusters of data within the graph.   Both challenges will include a small graph problem in the billions of nodes and a large graph problem in the trillions of nodes.   |/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;/news-events/2017-06-02.html,Extracting Insight from the Data Deluge Is a Hard-to-Do Must-Do ;/staff/dr-jonathan-odom.html,Dr. Jonathan Odom;/news-events/artificial-intelligence-colloquium.html,Artificial Intelligence Colloquium;/news-events/hierarchical-identify-verify-exploit-proposers-day.html,Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) Proposers Day

The numerous tactical advantages offered by operating at higher frequencies, most notably the wide bandwidths available, is driving both commercial and DoD solid-state and vacuum electronic amplifiers into the millimeter wave (mm-wave) spectrum above 30 GHz. Control of the mm-wave spectrum requires advanced and ever more sophisticated electronic components and systems. The performance of these systems strongly depends on the available amplifier power..  The High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) program seeks to develop mm-wave vacuum electronic amplifiers for air, ground, and ship-based EM systems. HAVOC amplifiers would enable these systems to access the high-frequency millimeter-wave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, facilitating increased range and other performance improvements such as high data-rate communications and high-resolution sensing. Additionally, in the future the HAVOC program plans to support basic research to improve the fundamental understanding of the various phenomena governing the science and technology that will underlie the next generation of mm-wave vacuum electronic amplifiers. |/news-events/2016-06-16a.html,Finessing Miniaturized Magnetics into the Microelectronics Mix;/news-events/2014-10-28.html,DARPA Circuit Achieves Speeds of 1 Trillion Cycles per Second, Earns Guinness World Record;/news-events/2014-06-30.html,ELASTx Stretches Potential for Future Communications Technologies with Fully Integrated All-Silicon “System on a Chip” Transmitter;/news-events/2013-11-21.html,Chips meet Tubes: World’s First Terahertz Vacuum Amplifier;/news-events/2013-03-26.html,World Record Silicon-based Millimeter-wave Power Amplifiers

The DoD’s use of OSS saves cost, increases maintainability, and attracts developer talent, but also creates an unprecedented attack surface, in which many trusted software parts and paths are exposed to hostile manipulation. Manipulators can leverage the full scope of social mechanisms and incentives that make the OSS sociotechnical ecosystem so valuable.Today, the integrity of these ecosystems relies on manual effort by their respective stewards, who typically act on implicit trust and perceived reputation. Situational awareness is a matter of heuristics, such as the so-called “bus factor” of a project, and hunches based on long-term community participation. As a result, OSS stewards struggle to protect the integrity of their projects. Moreover, tracking the dependencies of modern software ecosystems requires sustained, dedicated effort that cannot be expected of any individual or group of stewards.For OSS projects that take the stance of not publicly distinguishing between exploitable bugs and functional bugs, adversaries may glean critical information before mitigations are completed, and interfere with the mitigations. Social media campaigns to disrupt or distract OSS developer communities can be highly effective, even if mounted by a few individuals against a large and well-established community. Since development of OSS is essentially a social process, such disruptions present a growing concern.The AIE SocialCyber Opportunity aims to explore capabilities to detect and counteract cyber-social operations that may target OSS developer communities. SocialCyber seeks to explore hybrid methods that combine analyses of source code, development-related communication artifacts, and multi-modal social media activities related to open source development to protect the integrity of open source infrastructure critical to the DoD.Additional information is available in the Hybrid AI to Protect Integrity of Open Source Code (SocialCyber) Program Announcement. |/news-events/artificial-intelligence-colloquium.html,Artificial Intelligence Colloquium;/news-events/2022-11-28.html,U.S. Cyber Command, DARPA Initiate Rapid Cyber Capability Prototyping and Integration Pilot ;/news-events/2022-10-24.html,DARPA’s CASTLE to Fortify Computer Networks;/news-events/2022-07-21.html,Voices from DARPA Podcast Episode 58: The Cryptoprivacist;/news-events/2022-06-03.html,DARPA’s ANSR to Improving Trustworthy AI

Adversaries exploit misinformation and true information delivered via influence messaging: blogs, tweets, and other online multimedia content. Analysts require effective tools for continual sensemaking of the vast, noisy, adaptive information environment to identify adversary influence campaigns.Today, geopolitical influence campaign detection and sensemaking is largely manual and ad hoc. Analysts use social listening tools to formulate complex keyword queries; track trending keywords, hashtags, and topics; and read hundreds to thousands of documents to identify influence themes. New or “low and slow” campaigns are hard to detect early as their message volume may be beneath platform “trending” thresholds and pertinent hashtags may be unknown. With current tools, it is difficult to connect messages over time and across multiple platforms to track evolving campaigns and to assess confidence in analytic conclusions in a rigorous manner. Confidence assessment by analysts is ad hoc, manual, subjective, qualitative, and susceptible to analyst cognitive biases (e.g., confirmation bias). Analyst reports often cover static time ranges, and static reports quickly become stale.With current tools, analysts must manually sift through a high volume of messages to find those with relevant influence agendas then gauge which ones are gaining traction and with whom. Analysts track population response using digital marketing tools for analyzing audience demographics, interests, and personality. These tools lack explanatory and predictive power for deeper issues of geopolitical influence. Audience analysis is often done using static, demographic segmentation based on online and survey data. This lacks the flexibility, resolution, and timeliness needed for dynamic geopolitical influence campaign detection and sensemaking.The Influence Campaign Awareness and Sensemaking (INCAS) program will develop techniques and tools that enable analysts to detect, characterize, and track geopolitical influence campaigns with quantified confidence.For more information, see the INCAS Broad Agency Announcement.|/news-events/influence-campaign-awareness-and-sensemaking.html,INfluence Campaign Awareness and Sensemaking (INCAS);/news-events/2022-06-16.html,Voices from DARPA Podcast Episode 57: Unmasking Misinformation & Manipulation;/news-events/2021-09-02.html,DARPA Announces Researchers Selected to INCAS Program;/program/modeling-influence-pathways.html,Modeling Influence Pathways;/news-events/2021-05-03a.html,Creating AI-Enabled Cultural Interpreters to Aid Defense Operations

Reaching the performance levels required by these DoD applications however will require developing highly complex system-on-chip (SoC) platforms that leverage the most advanced integrated circuit technologies. Despite advances in electronic design automation (EDA) tools, the complexity associated with the design and verification of integrated circuits (ICs) continues to increase rapidly due in part to the steady progress of Moore's Law. To help meet design requirements, commercial electronics manufacturers creating advanced hardware solutions will employ large teams of designers, each with expertise in a specific facet of the design flow. For the DoD however, researchers and development teams do not have the resources available to effectively execute such a strategy, resulting in hardware design cycles that are two to three times longer than commercial establishments.To overcome the design expertise gap and keep pace with the exponential increase in chip complexity, the Intelligent Design of Electronic Assets (IDEA) program seeks to develop a general purpose hardware compiler for no-human-in-the-loop translation of source code or schematic to physical layout (GDSII) for SoCs, System-In-Packages (SIPs), and Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) in less than 24 hours. The program aims to leverage advances in applied machine learning, optimization algorithms, and expert systems to create a compiler that could allow users with no prior design expertise to complete physical design at the most advanced technology nodes. The goal of the IDEA program is to provide the DoD with a path to rapid development of next-generation electronic systems without the need for large design teams, reducing the cost and complexity barriers associated with leading-edge electronic design. |/news-events/electronics-resurgence-initiative-summit.html,Electronics Resurgence Initiative Summit;/news-events/2021-12-22.html,DARPA Joins Public-Private Partnership to Address Challenges Facing Microelectronics Advancement;/news-events/2020-06-17.html,DARPA Announces Third-Annual Electronics Resurgence Initiative Summit & MTO Symposium;/news-events/2019-05-31.html,DARPA Announces ERI Summit 2019 Workshops;/news-events/2019-04-05.html,DARPA Announces Second Annual ERI Summit

Today’s metrics fail to capture numerous nuanced factors that differentiate a harmless software flaw from a potent vulnerability, which means critical vulnerabilities often go unfixed as resources are allocated to less significant issues.Without accurate methods to measure the exploitability of a particular vulnerability, developers and defenders must rely on empirical evidence to assess its severity and prioritize it for remediation. Such evidence requires time and costly resources and is often insufficient or incomplete, especially for vulnerabilities within complex systems.   DARPA’s Intelligent Generation of Tools for Security (INGOTS) program aims to identify and fix high-severity, chainable vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them. INGOTS will pioneer new techniques driven by program analysis and artificial intelligence to measure vulnerabilities within modern, complex systems, such as web browsers and mobile operating systems. Rather than develop a fully automatic process, INGOTS intends to create a computer-human pipeline that seamlessly allows human intervention in order to fix high-severity vulnerabilities before an attack. Successful INGOTS research will improve software and hardware resiliency of pervasive commercial devices by rapidly identifying and prioritizing their most dangerous flaws.INGOTS is a three-year program with two phases. Phase 1 will focus on exploring, designing, developing, and demonstrating tools and techniques. Phase 2 will focus on maturing and refining these tools and techniques and expanding their coverage across vulnerability and exploitation classes. Each phase will have intermediate meetings, hackathons, and demonstrations and will end with an evaluation in collaboration with government partners.Additional information is available in the INGOTS broad agency announcement.|https://sam.gov/opp/7afef7eed5db4ff490971d0667cbaa48/view.html,Intelligent Generation of Tools for Security (INGOTS);/staff/dr-dan-wallach.html,Dr. Dan Wallach;/news-events/artificial-intelligence-colloquium.html,Artificial Intelligence Colloquium;/news-events/darpa-finding-exploits-to-thwart-tampering.html,DARPA Finding Exploits to Thwart Tampering (FETT) Bug Bounty Capture-the-Flag Qualifier;/news-events/hardening-development-toolchains-against-emergent-execution-engines-proposers-day.html,Hardening Development Toolchains Against Emergent Execution Engines (HARDEN) Proposers Day
Intent-Defined Adaptive Software (IDAS) |Managing complexity is a central problem in software engineering. A common approach to address this challenge is concretization, in which a software engineer makes decisions based on  a set of apparently or almost equivalent options to enable the resulting code to compile. Concretization makes the process of software development more controllable, allowing the engineer to define and implement an architecture, divide the development tasks into manageable parts, establish conventions to enable their integration, and integrate them into a cohesive software system.|https://www.darpa.mil/JSON/program/intent-defined-adaptive-software.json|I2O|Mr. William Martin|/staff/mr-william-martin.html|Automation,Automation Technologies,/tag-list.html?tag=Automation;Programming,Software Programming,/tag-list.html?tag=Programming;Systems,Systems of Systems,/tag-list.html?tag=Systems|Managing complexity is a central problem in software engineering. A common approach to address this challenge is concretization, in which a software engineer makes decisions based on  a set of apparently or almost equivalent options to enable the resulting code to compile. Concretization makes the process of software development more controllable, allowing the engineer to define and implement an architecture, divide the development tasks into manageable parts, establish conventions to enable their integration, and integrate them into a cohesive software system. This process occurs at design time, when information about possible future requirements may not be available to guide the selection of concrete values or types. As a result, a substantial fraction of these choices will be wrong at some point in the system’s lifecycle due to unanticipated requirements or changes in computing resources. Adapting to changes and/or upgrading systems to take advantage of modern security and computational resources often requires many hours of effort to either completely reengineer the software, or meticulously change and test interfaces across dozens or hundreds of dependencies.The Intent-Defined Adaptive Software (IDAS) program seeks to develop technologies that capture the intentions of software engineers to support the continual adaptation of DoD software-enabled systems. The program seeks to develop new methods for representing the intent of software and its abstract constraints separately from its concrete instantiation by leveraging automated methods to adjust to a particular instance. Technologies developed on the IDAS program will enable rapid adaptation of software to changes in requirements and/or operating environments. The key idea of IDAS is the separation of problem description (in terms of intentions and constraints) from any particular, concrete instantiation. This intent and constraint model must be semantically accessible to an IDAS toolchain, yet expressive enough to capture the relationships between the problem and the method by which generated software can solve and validate a solution. Through additional automation of specific implementation generation, the software sustainment effort required should be drastically reduced, freeing engineers to focus on the design of the software and adding new functionality. Achieving the goals of IDAS will require research breakthroughs in: Capturing, learning, or annotating software intent and constraints separate from the concrete decisions required to create a specific instance of softwareUsing captured intent to drastically reduce the human-in-the-loop effort needed to adapt software to new requirements, platforms, and resourcesVerifying that the newly-adapted software provides the functional needs of the customer/end user and that the instance does not violate any requirementsIntegrating a new intent-defined software development paradigm into existing Agile workflows to enable adoption and transition into the greater programmer communityIDAS Proposers Day: Program Overview (Video)IDAS Proposers Day: CMO (Video)IDAS Proposers Day: Q & A (Video)IDAS Proposers Day: Feasibility Study (Video) |/news-events/2023-03-27.html,Show Us the Proof: Formal Methods Can Be Applied at Large Scale;/news-events/2019-07-02.html,Automating the Software Sustainment Loop;/program/pipelined-reasoning-of-verifiers-enabling-robust-systems.html,Pipelined Reasoning of Verifiers Enabling Robust Systems;/program/proof-engineering-adaptation-repair-and-learning-for-software.html,Proof Engineering, Adaptation, Repair, and Learning for Software;https://sam.gov/opp/bcf34cd2d80f4a109c5c15b75ed2063d/view.html,Pipelined Reasoning of Verifiers Enabling Robust Systems (PROVERS) Proposers Day
INTERfering and Co-Evolving Prevention and Therapy  (INTERCEPT) |Viral pathogens pose a continuous and shifting biological threat to military readiness and national security overall in the form of infectious disease with pandemic potential.

Today’s limited vaccines and other antivirals are often circumvented by quickly mutating viruses that evolve to develop resistance to treatments that are carefully formulated to act only specific strains of a virus. DARPA’s INTERfering and Co-Evolving Prevention and Therapy (INTERCEPT) program aims to harness viral evolution to create a novel, adaptive form of medical countermeasure—therapeutic interfering particles (TIPs)—that outcompetes viruses in the body to prevent or treat infection. Whereas current preventive and therapeutic approaches are designed to target viruses in their original state at the time of discovery or diagnosis, INTERCEPT uses viral evolution as the basis for its protective effect. Because TIPs are harmless, virus-derived particles with defective genomes that can only replicate in the presence of virus, they interfere with viral infection by competing for essential viral components. And, just like their parent virus, TIPs are susceptible to mutation over time and co-evolve with the mutating virus, thus diminishing the virus’ ability to evade the therapeutic.Over the course of this countermeasure-development effort, INTERCEPT performer teams will use novel molecular and genetic design tools, high throughput genomic technologies, and advanced computational methods to address TIP safety, efficacy, long-term co-evolution, and generalizability. If successful, INTERCEPT will deliver new treatments for fast-evolving viruses such as Ebola, SARS, Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya—providing broad coverage against multiple strains—and make available a platform technology that could be readily adapted to confront even engineered viral threats. |/news-events/2020-11-10.html,DARPA’s Early Investment in COVID-19 Antibody Identification Producing Timely Results;/program/autonomous-diagnostics-to-enable-prevention-and-therapeutics.html,Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics ;/program/pandemic-prevention-platform.html,Pandemic Prevention Platform ;/program/preemptive-expression-of-protective-alleles-and-response-elements.html,PReemptive Expression of Protective Alleles and Response Elements;/staff/dr-shannon-greene.html,Dr. Shannon Greene

In almost all of these cases, prior information enables more efficient or more accurate information recovery from measurement results. More importantly, even without prior information, intelligently and continually adapting the measurement basis in response to earlier measurement results enables superior performance for many information retrieval tasks.The Investigating Adaptive Modal Bases for Intelligent Classification (IAMBIC) Disruption Opportunity (DO) is an effort to create new frameworks for analyzing when such adaptive measurement bases can provide significant, real-world advantage for important problems.IAMBIC performers will develop a cohesive and general theoretical framework for adaptively varying measurement bases in response to initial measurement data. They will apply their adaptive measurement framework on two (or more) tasks: The first task will address the DARPA-defined Constellation Challenge problem of imaging groups of unresolved sources beyond the Rayleigh resolution limit, in order to quantitatively bound the conditions under which adaptive modal imaging provides a positive real- world impact for the specific problem of sub-Rayleigh-resolution imaging. The other measurement tasks are performer-defined. The performers will analyze these tasks using their adaptive measurement framework and show that their strategy provides a significant real-world impact. |/news-events/2022-09-02.html,Revolutionizing Infrared Sensing Could Transform Imaging Applications;/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;/program/optomechanical-thermal-imaging.html,Optomechanical Thermal Imaging;/news-events/driven-and-nonequilibrium-quantum-systems-proposers-day.html,Driven and Nonequilibrium Quantum Systems (DRINQS) Proposers Day;/news-events/invisible-headlights-proposers-day.html,Invisible Headlights Proposers Day

Commercial companies increasingly recognize the need to differentiate their products through research in areas other than device scaling, such as new circuit architectures and computing algorithms. At the same time, the DoD has increasing computation needs in autonomous and distributed systems that will require advances beyond the current Moore’s Law roadmap. Cognitive electronics warfare (EW), secure communications, and advanced imaging will all need computation performance at power that will require the most advanced fabrication processes, but also new architectures and computing algorithms. Without these advances, the promise of new algorithms and capabilities for the warfighter will not be realized. DARPA, along with companies from the semiconductor and defense industries—Intel, IBM, Micron, Analog Devices, EMD Performance Materials, ARM, Samsung, TSMC, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, and Lockheed Martin—have initiated the Joint University Microelectronics Program (JUMP) with six research centers to undertake high-risk, high-payoff research that addresses existing and emerging challenges in microelectronic technologies. JUMP comes at an inflection point in the history of the semiconductor industry where application and system research is critical to enabling the development of superior electronic systems to meet both DoD and commercial needs.Under JUMP, the challenges of the “application-centric” research centers focus on accomplishing application-oriented goals and spurring the development of complex systems with capabilities well beyond those available today. Diving deep into cognitive computing, intelligent memory and storage, distributed computing and networking, and radio frequency (RF) to terahertz (THz) sensor and communications systems, among other areas, these research centers will strive to develop systems that will be transferable to military and industry in a five year timeframe and ready for field deployment in 10.The four application-centric JUMP centers are:The Center for Brain-inspired Computing Enabling Autonomous Intelligence (C-BRIC) aims to deliver major advances in cognitive computing, with the goal of enabling a new generation of autonomous intelligent systems.The Center for Converged TeraHertz Communications and Sensing (ComSenTer) seeks to develop technologies for a future cellular infrastructure designed to support the autonomous vehicle revolution and the emergence of intelligent highways.The Computing On Network Infrastructure for Pervasive Perception, Cognition, and Action (CONIX) center is striving to develop an architecture for networked computing that lies between edge devices and the cloud.The Center for Research on Intelligent Storage and Processing-in-memory (CRISP) is working to topple the “memory wall”–a 70-year-old technical bottleneck in computer systems that is hindering the use of big data for technical discovery. In addition, two “disciplinary” research centers will take on the challenge of driving foundational developments around specific disciplines with the goal of creating disruptive breakthroughs in areas relevant to JUMP sponsors, including advanced architectures and algorithms, and advanced devices, packaging, and materials. The two disciplinary JUMP centers are:The Applications Driving Architectures (ADA) Center is researching new areas that reduce the cost, complexity, and energy required to develop advanced computing systems by democratizing the design and manufacturing process.The Applications and Systems driven Center for Energy-Efficient Integrated Nanotechnologies (ASCENT) focuses on material and device innovations to transcend the anticipated limits of current CMOS technology in order to increase the performance, efficiency, and capabilities of future computing systems. |/news-events/electronics-resurgence-initiative-summit.html,Electronics Resurgence Initiative Summit;/news-events/2021-12-22.html,DARPA Joins Public-Private Partnership to Address Challenges Facing Microelectronics Advancement;/news-events/2020-06-17.html,DARPA Announces Third-Annual Electronics Resurgence Initiative Summit & MTO Symposium;/news-events/2019-05-31.html,DARPA Announces ERI Summit 2019 Workshops;/news-events/2019-04-05.html,DARPA Announces Second Annual ERI Summit

KMASS technology seeks to scale to a broad set of tasks and contexts across an organization by collecting and modifying knowledge “in-the-flow” as part of regular task execution and applying the knowledge documented for one purpose to other purposes as appropriate. The goal of the KMASS program is to deliver user specific knowledge “nuggets” that are useful for a current task—whether the knowledge is requested or not by the user—exactly when needed, while avoiding irrelevant or already known information. This concept is a core tenet of KMASS and may be referred to as the “JustINs” – i.e., just in time, just enough, and just for me.1 KMASS systems also will contain a persistent knowledge store comprising source documents in human understandable form in multiple modalities (e.g., text, videos, presentations, etc.), augmented with appropriate tags and indexed for identification, retrieval, linking, and application that will update at the speed of task performance. KMASS requires advances in three key complementary areas: organizing background knowledge, capturing local knowledge, and disseminating contextualized knowledge usefully, appropriately, and on time.1Rosenberg, M.

Humans make sense of events by organizing them into narrative structures that occur frequently. These structures are abstracted into schemas, which are organized units of knowledge that represent a pattern of memory used in human cognition. First-wave, or rule-based, symbolic reasoning, AI systems that incorporated hand-crafted schemas were unable to scale when matching those schemas to real-world data. Second-wave, or machine learning, AI systems require far too many manually-produced, annotated examples as training data for supervised machine learning methods to be practical.The Knowledge-directed Artificial Intelligence Reasoning Over Schemas (KAIROS) program seeks to develop a schema-based AI system that can identify complex events and bring them to the attention of users.  KAIROS aims to understand complex events described in multimedia inputs by developing a semi-automated system that identifies, links, and temporally sequences their subsidiary elements, the participants involved, as well as the complex event type.  Events of interest either create changes that have significant impact on national security or participate in causal chains that produce such impacts.The KAIROS program seeks to overcome the scaling limitations of prior approaches in two stages.  As shown in the figure below, the first stage entails the development of automated approaches for learning schemas from big data, and the second stage focuses on the development of automated technologies that apply these schemas to multi-media/multilingual information to discover and extract complex events of interest to KAIROS users.  A KAIROS Proposers Day was held January 9, 2019 in Arlington, VA. |/news-events/hierarchical-identify-verify-exploit-proposers-day.html,Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) Proposers Day;/news-events/knowledge-management-at-scale-and-speed-proposers-day.html,Knowledge Management at Scale and Speed (KMASS) Proposers Day;/news-events/2022-09-23.html,DARPA Selects Teams to Improve How Scientists Build/Sustain Models, Simulations ;/news-events/2021-06-21.html,Ensuring Continuity of Knowledge During Unit Rotations, Individual Replacements;/news-events/2019-01-04.html,Generating Actionable Understanding of Real-World Phenomena with AI

LUMOS seeks to develop integrated photonics technology along three vectors: scaling complexity, scaling power, and scaling spectrum. To achieve improved scaling in complexity, LUMOS seeks to integrate thousands of lasers and amplifiers with highly complex photonic integrated circuits for applications such as compact optical phased array LiDAR and neuromorphic optical computing. To achieve power scaling, LUMOS will aim to develop Watt-class lasers on a low-loss, high-speed photonics platform for radio frequency (RF) and microwave applications. For scaling across the spectrum, LUMOS aims to create photonic circuits with integrated lasers operating across the visible spectrum with a wavelength-by-design methodology to enable atomic microsystems for positioning, navigation, and timing applications, as well as compact quantum sensors and information processing systems. |/news-events/2017-09-07,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;/news-events/2013-10-23,Tiny Sensors Put the Squeeze on Light;/program/optical-radiation-cooling-and-heating-in-integrated-devices,Optical Radiation Cooling and Heating in Integrated Devices ;/staff/dr-justin-cohen,Dr. Justin Cohen;/news-events/2022-10-05,DARPA Seeks Innovators to Accelerate Pace of Scientific Discovery

The Department of Defense (DoD) systems are particularly long-lived, so ongoing adaptation would permit continual modification as missions and theaters change, providing a strategic advantage over an adversary.The Learning Introspective Control (LINC) program aims to develop machine learning-based introspection technologies that enable physical systems, with specific interest in ground vehicles, ships, drone swarms, and robotic systems, to respond to events not predicted at design time. LINC technologies endeavors to update control laws as required in real time while providing guidance and situational awareness to the operator, whether that operator is human or an autonomous controller.The current approach to handling platform damage or modification places the burden of recovery and control on the operator. LINC seeks to develop machine introspection and learning technologies that continually compare the real-time behavior of a military platform – as measured by on-board sensors – with a learned model of the platform, determine whether the observed behavior differs from that model in ways that might compromise stability and control, and implement an updated control law when required and effectively communicate those updates to the operator. This allows the operator to maintain effective control and trust in the platform.

Learning with Less Labeling (LwLL) |In supervised machine learning (ML), the ML system learns by example to recognize things, such as objects in images or speech. Humans provide these examples to ML systems during their training in the form of labeled data. With enough labeled data, we can generally build accurate pattern recognition models.|https://www.darpa.mil/JSON/program/learning-with-less-labeling.json|I2O|Dr. Matthew Wilding|/staff/dr-matthew-wilding.html|Algorithms,Algorithms,/tag-list.html?tag=Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence,Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Symbiosis Technologies,/tag-list.html?tag=Artificial Intelligence;Data,Data Analysis at Massive Scales,/tag-list.html?tag=Data|In supervised machine learning (ML), the ML system learns by example to recognize things, such as objects in images or speech. Humans provide these examples to ML systems during their training in the form of labeled data. With enough labeled data, we can generally build accurate pattern recognition models.The problem is that training accurate models currently requires lots of labeled data. For tasks like machine translation, speech recognition or object recognition, deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as the state of the art, due to the superior accuracy they can achieve. To gain this advantage over other techniques, however, DNN models need more data, typically requiring 109 or 1010 labeled training examples to achieve good performance.The commercial world has harvested and created large sets of labeled data for training models.  These datasets are often created via crowdsourcing: a cheap and efficient way to create labeled data. Unfortunately, crowdsourcing techniques are often not possible for proprietary or sensitive data. Creating data sets for these sorts of problems can result in 100x higher costs and 50x longer time to label. To make matters worse, machine learning models are brittle, in that their performance can degrade severely with small changes in their operating environment. For instance, the performance of computer vision systems degrades when data is collected from a new sensor and new collection viewpoints. Similarly, dialog and text understanding systems are very sensitive to changes in formality and register. As a result, additional labels are needed after initial training to adapt these models to new environments and data collection conditions. For many problems, the labeled data required to adapt models to new environments approaches the amount required to train a new model from scratch.The Learning with Less Labeling (LwLL) program aims to make the process of training machine learning models more efficient by reducing the amount of labeled data required to build a model by six or more orders of magnitude, and by reducing the amount of data needed to adapt models to new environments to tens to hundreds of labeled examples.   In order to achieve the massive reductions of labeled data needed to train accurate models, the LwLL program will focus on two technical objectives:Development of learning algorithms that learn and adapt efficiently; andFormally characterize machine learning problems and prove the limits of learning and adaptation.Additional information is available in the LwLL BAA  |/news-events/artificial-intelligence-colloquium.html,Artificial Intelligence Colloquium;/news-events/artificial-intelligence-for-critical-mineral-assessment-competition.html,Artificial Intelligence for Critical Mineral Assessment Competition;/news-events/hierarchical-identify-verify-exploit-proposers-day.html,Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) Proposers Day;/news-events/perceptually-enabled-task-guidance-proposers-day.html,Perceptually-enabled Task Guidance (PTG) Proposers Day;/news-events/trades-proposers-day.html,TRAnsformative DESign (TRADES) Proposers Day

Historically, improvements in HPC have been driven by new generations of integrated circuit (IC) technologies and continuous improvements in transistor density, performance, and energy efficiency (Moore’s Law). However, this paradigm is no longer bringing significant advances to HPC due to the difficulty in continuing conventional scaling — particularly in power reduction. The limitations of conventional computing technologies make it even more difficult to keep pace with the demands for faster and denser computational power in ways that are also energy efficient. To overcome the barriers to transistor scaling in HPC systems, the Low Temperature Logic Technology (LTLT) program seeks to develop a semiconductor technology optimized for low temperature (77K) operation based on advanced, very large-scale integration (VLSI) manufacturing platforms. LTLT also aims to demonstrate a 25X improvement in performance/power of state-of-the-art (SOA) CPUs compared to room-temperature operation. The LTLT program will focus on exploring a fabrication technology for highly integrated, advanced node complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) logic operating at 77K, with low supply voltage and high performance, and to establish scalability to future technology nodes. The program will also explore advanced research concepts focused on high-risk/high-payoff FinFET VLSI-compatible solutions at 77K, where new circuit techniques utilize novel LTLT transistors and memory cells to achieve a 45X performance/power improvement. |/news-events/electronics-resurgence-initiative-summit.html,Electronics Resurgence Initiative Summit;/news-events/lasers-for-universal-microscale-optical-systems-proposers-day.html,Lasers for Universal Microscale Optical Systems (LUMOS) Proposers Day;/news-events/2021-12-22.html,DARPA Joins Public-Private Partnership to Address Challenges Facing Microelectronics Advancement;/news-events/2020-12-01.html,DARPA Looks to Light up Integrated Photonics with Chip-Scale Laser Development;/news-events/2020-06-17.html,DARPA Announces Third-Annual Electronics Resurgence Initiative Summit & MTO Symposium

Its absence is perhaps the most significant barrier between the narrowly focused AI applications we have today and the more general, human-like AI systems we would like to build in the future.

Recent advances in machine learning have created new AI capabilities, but machine reasoning across these applications remains narrow and highly specialized. Current machine learning systems must be carefully trained or programmed for every situation. Common sense is defined as, “the basic ability to perceive, understand, and judge things that are shared by (‘common to’) nearly all people and can reasonably be expected of nearly all people without need for debate.”1 Humans are usually not conscious of the vast sea of commonsense assumptions that underlie every statement or action. This shared, unstated background knowledge includes a general understanding of how the physical world works (i.e., intuitive physics), a basic understanding of human motives and behaviors (i.e., intuitive psychology), and a knowledge of the common facts that an average adult possesses. The absence of common sense prevents intelligent systems from understanding their world, behaving reasonably in unforeseen situations, communicating naturally with people, and learning from new experiences. Its absence is considered the most significant barrier between the narrowly focused AI applications of today and the more general, human-like AI systems hoped for in the future. Common sense reasoning’s obscure but pervasive nature makes it difficult to articulate and encode.The Machine Common Sense (MCS) program seeks to address the challenge of machine common sense by pursuing two broad strategies. Both envision machine common sense as a computational service, or as machine commonsense services. The first strategy aims to create a service that learns from experience, like a child, to construct computational models that mimic the core domains of child cognition for objects (intuitive physics), agents (intentional actors), and places (spatial navigation). The second strategy seeks to develop a service that learns from reading the Web, like a research librarian, to construct a commonsense knowledge repository capable of answering natural language and image-based questions about commonsense phenomena.

This limits the utility of the magnetic components as well as their ability to impact overall system performance and function. Reducing the size, weight, and power (SWaP) of magnetic components and integrating them onto semiconductor chips, however, could enable broader exploitation of magnetic materials and provide new mechanisms for the control and manipulation of EM signals. For instance, tighter integration of electronic and magnetic components could yield smaller radar systems, higher bandwidth communication over longer ranges, improved jam resistance, and more resilient EW systems.

If the program succeeds, MBA technologies will give warfighters the ability to understand the underlying biological processes that govern their performance. Specifically, these technologies would elucidate the internal expression circuits (e.g., genetic, epigenetic, metabolomic) that shape militarily relevant cognitive, behavioral, and physical traits. New devices for continuously tracking these expression circuits could be integrated into the body to provide instantaneous user feedback, helping the warfighter to improve performance throughout training, assessment, selection, and mission execution for a given military specialty.Successful MBA technologies would change how the Department of Defense understands individual warfighters, updating a more than 50-year-old evaluation system that is based on inadequate screening and aptitude tests supplemented by annual medical examinations. This long-awaited modernization of performance measurement would provide a complete picture of the warfighter, tying performance traits to myriad signaling networks in the body that drive specific aspects of performance.

To comprehensively understand the scope of these activities, MICE technologies will aim to discover and track changes over time to adversary techniques across various abstractions of the information environment from the network level (e.g., netflow, DNS, IP address, protocol, applications, etc.) to the information level (e.g., topics, images, audio, video, etc.).Additional information is available in the MICE Program Announcement. |/news-events/artificial-intelligence-colloquium.html,Artificial Intelligence Colloquium;/news-events/2023-04-10.html,The Key to Securing Legacy Computing Systems;/news-events/2022-11-28.html,U.S. Cyber Command, DARPA Initiate Rapid Cyber Capability Prototyping and Integration Pilot ;/news-events/2022-10-24.html,DARPA’s CASTLE to Fortify Computer Networks;/news-events/2022-07-21.html,Voices from DARPA Podcast Episode 58: The Cryptoprivacist

Modern textiles achieve both strength and flexibility by weaving fabric fibers in different patterns of various sizes, shapes, and topology. The ability to similarly weave and braid polymer chains on the molecular scale could reap analogous benefits on the nanoscale. Indeed, recent studies have created molecular woven nanomaterials, some of which have been shown to enhance mechanical properties when used as fillers in conventional polymers. However, these efforts have not produced MIMs on a scale suitable for DoD applications. To fully realize the technological advantage of these novel materials, disruptive advances are needed to improve our ability to design, synthesize, characterize, and produce these materials at scale.The MIMs program will focus on identifying new, scalable synthetic and biological methodologies to create mechanically interlocked and woven polymer architectures via molecular assembly. New methodologies will provide precision control over molecular composition, topology, and dimensionality that can be synthesized beyond the laboratory scale. MIMs will modulate polymer characteristics to simultaneously achieve both flexibility and strength by utilizing mechanical interlocking as a means to increase intermolecular interactions without sacrificing flexibility and solubility. Ultimately, MIMs could find use in integrated, breathable armors, chemical and biological protective coatings, and as controlled drug release wound dressings. |/news-events/morphogenic-interfaces-proposers-day.html,Morphogenic Interfaces (MINT) Proposers Day;/news-events/-2023-05-18.html,Taking a New Look at Fundamental Tech for Quiet Undersea Propulsion;/news-events/2023-05-18.html,Voices from DARPA Podcast Episode 68: Space Manufacturing;/news-events/2023-03-23.html,Concrete in Disrepair?

Today’s millimeter wave systems, however, are not user friendly and are designed to be platform specific, lacking interoperability and are thus reserved for only the most complex platforms. To expand the use of millimeter wave phased-arrays and make them broadly applicable across Department of Defense (DoD) systems, many technical challenges must be addressed, including wideband frequency coverage, precision beam pointing, user discover and mesh networking.The goal of the Millimeter-Wave Digital Arrays (MIDAS) program is to create the digital array technology that will enable next-generation DoD millimeter wave systems. The program seeks to develop element-level digital beamforming that will support emerging multi-beam communications and directional sensing of the electromagnetic environment in the 18-50 GHz band.  To accomplish its goals, MIDAS is focused on two key technical areas – one that addresses the development of core CMOS chips, and a second that seeks to integrate those CMOS chips with the rest of the aperture. The challenge associated with developing the CMOS chips is achieving the very low power consumption needed, but with a large amount of RF, mixed-signal, and digital functionality integrated into a very small space.  The second challenge is to implement the low-noise amplifiers, power amplifiers, transmit/receive switches, and antenna all with high efficiency and compact chip-scale assembly techniques. Achieving both of these goals will result in a 16-element tile building block that can be used to form larger apertures.  In the third phase of the program, the focus will be on the creation of a 256-element array that is composed of the MIDAS tile building blocks and is capable of demonstrating digital multi-beam functionality over the full band of interest. |/news-events/2018-01-24.html,DARPA Seeks to Improve Military Communications with  Digital Phased-Arrays at Millimeter Wave;/news-events/sync-with-sto.html,Sync with STO;/news-events/2017-08-04.html,Strategic Technology Office Outlines Vision for “Mosaic Warfare”;/news-events/2017-06-23.html,DARPA to Host “Sync with STO” Event;/news-events/2017-03-30.html,Battle of the ModRecs Lays Groundwork for Improved Spectrum Management

To accomplish its goals, MGM is making strategic yield and reproducibility improvements that leverage Standard Evaluation Circuits (SEC), Process Control Monitors (PCM), and short loop fabrication to identify targeted process step improvements. Additionally, reliability assessment through the use of accelerated life testing is used to gauge success and Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) is evaluated throughout the program. MPWs are used to engage with a diverse set of users to provide regular feedback on circuit performance, model correlation and design kit usability. |/news-events/2023-03-22.html,Breaking the One Part-One Material Paradigm;/news-events/2022-03-23.html,DARPA Kicks Off Program to Explore Space-Based Manufacturing;/news-events/2021-02-05.html,Orbital Construction: DARPA Pursues Plan for Robust Manufacturing in Space;/program/multiobjective-engineering-and-testing-of-alloy-structures.html,Multiobjective Engineering and Testing of Alloy Structures;/program/novel-orbital-and-moon-manufacturing-materials-and-mass-efficient-design.html,Novel Orbital and Moon Manufacturing, Materials, and Mass-efficient Design

MAA assumes that an adversary’s WMT activities will result in observable transactions. While the probability that any one source alone will reveal a WMT threat may be low, the probability of detecting a WMT threat can be increased by appropriately integrating multiple sources of transaction data.MAA requires synthetic transaction data to drive the development of techniques and tools in ways that will avoid the privacy and classification issues that can be associated with real-world data. MAA will develop the means to create synthetic transaction data sets that are both realistic and fully releasable to the scientific community, i.e., data that contains neither personally identifiable information nor restrictions with respect to classification. Because transaction data may very naturally be modelled using graphs, mathematical and computational methods to enable large-scale graph analytics including graph alignment and merging, sub-graph detection, and sub-graph matching are of particular interest.Additional details are available at DARPA-BAA-16-61: Modeling Adversarial Activity. |/news-events/hierarchical-identify-verify-exploit-proposers-day.html,Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) Proposers Day;/news-events/systematizing-confidence-in-open-research-and-evidence-proposers-day.html,Systematizing Confidence in Open Research and Evidence (SCORE) Proposers Day;/news-events/2023-03-16a.html,Oversight Program Aims to Make Space Domain More Tactically Relevant for Military Planners, Warfighters;/news-events/2022-09-23.html,DARPA Selects Teams to Improve How Scientists Build/Sustain Models, Simulations ;/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced

False narratives reemerged in early 2022, with a variety of actors (e.g. foreign states and fringe groups) propagating the false information across a number of online and offline platforms and communities. Understanding the pathways by which different types of information propagate across the information ecosystem is important. In addition, identifying patterns that emerge among these pathways, such as the propagation from certain niche platforms to more mainstream platforms, is essential to understanding influence operations. Modeling Influence Pathways (MIPs) explores artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for the following:Connecting various identified influence messaging flows across platformsLearning, mapping, and modeling which pathways are used by what types of informationDiscovering patterns that characterize these pathwaysMIPs complements maturing capabilities for identification of misinformation, disinformation, and manipulated information with better mapping and understanding of the pathways used to disseminate and amplify that information. These pathways are not static but rather adapt to changes in the information ecosystem in response to emerging platforms, increasing platform moderation or censorship, or new types of messaging. Today, pathway discovery is often a manually intensive, retrospective process that fails to match the speed and scale of the information ecosystem. More automated, accurate, and timely identification of influence pathways will enable earlier anticipation and detection of new influence messaging flows; and better forecasting of the impact of changes to the ecosystem (e.g., platform policies) on information flows.

In addition to creating novel hardware and algorithms, the program conducts research to understand how various forms of neural sensing and actuation might improve restorative therapeutic outcomes.     The focus of the program is development of advanced neural interfaces that provide high signal resolution, speed, and volume data transfer between the brain and electronics, serving as a translator for the electrochemical language used by neurons in the brain and the ones and zeros that constitute the language of information technology. The program aims to develop an interface that can read 106 neurons, write to 105 neurons, and interact with 103 neurons full-duplex, a far greater scale than is possible with existing neurotechnology.To succeed, NESD requires integrated breakthroughs across disciplines including neuroscience, low-power electronics, photonics, medical device packaging and manufacturing, systems engineering, and clinical testing. In addition to hardware, NESD performer teams are developing advanced mathematical and neuro-computation techniques to first transcode high-definition sensory information between electronic and cortical neuron representations and then compress and represent those data with minimal loss of fidelity and functionality. If the program is successful, the work has the potential to significantly advance scientists' understanding of the neural underpinnings of vision, hearing, and speech and could eventually lead to new treatments for injured Service members living with sensory deficits. Additionally, NESD tools could yield new understanding of the architecture and processing of highly integrated neural circuits.  |/news-events/2022-04-04.html,Episode 55: Sensorized Prosthetics;/news-events/2019-10-17.html,New Generation of Intelligent Bio-Interfaces Could Overcome Aspects of Spinal Cord Injury;/news-events/2018-03-28.html,Progress in Quest to Develop a Human Memory Prosthesis;/news-events/2017-07-10.html,Towards a High-Resolution, Implantable Neural Interface;/news-events/2016-10-13.html,DARPA Helps Paralyzed Man Feel Again Using a Brain-Controlled Robotic Arm

Current methods to detect early signs of behavioral and mental health risk factors rely on self-reporting and screening questionnaires, which cannot reliably predict suicidality.The Neural Evidence Aggregation Tool (NEAT) program aims to overcome current limitations by developing a new cognitive science tool that identifies people at risk of suicide by using preconscious brain signals rather than asking questions and waiting for consciously filtered responses. By aggregating preconscious brain signals to stimuli, NEAT would determine what a person believes to be true, false, or indeterminate about specific types of knowledge that could be used to detect signs of depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation earlier and more reliably than ever before. If successful, NEAT will not only significantly augment behavioral health screening, but it could also serve as a new way to assess ultimate treatment efficacy, since patients will often tell their clinicians what they think the clinician wants to hear rather than how they are truly feeling. Ultimately, NEAT intends to augment current behavioral health screening programs by providing clinicians with previously unavailable information to enable earlier interventions and more reliable measures of successful treatment.________________________________ 1 High Suicide Rates among United States Service Members and Veterans of the Post9/11 Wars, Thomas Howard Suitt, III, Boston University, June 2021|/news-events/2022-03-02.html,New Cognitive Science Tool to Shed Light on Mental Health;/news-events/2022-11-15.html,DARPA Seeks Novel Approaches to Improve Mental Health, Prevent Suicide;/news-events/2022-09-22.html,Episode 60: The Neuroethicist;/news-events/2022-04-04.html,Episode 55: Sensorized Prosthetics;/news-events/2019-10-17.html,New Generation of Intelligent Bio-Interfaces Could Overcome Aspects of Spinal Cord Injury

Such interfaces would be enabling technology for diverse national security applications such as control of unmanned aerial vehicles and active cyber defense systems or teaming with computer systems to successfully multitask during complex military missions. Whereas the most effective, state-of-the-art neural interfaces require surgery to implant electrodes into the brain, N3 technology would not require surgery and would be man-portable, thus making the technology accessible to a far wider population of potential users. Noninvasive neurotechnologies such as the electroencephalogram and transcranial direct current stimulation already exist, but do not offer the precision, signal resolution, and portability required for advanced applications by people working in real-world settings.The envisioned N3 technology breaks through the limitations of existing technology by delivering an integrated device that does not require surgical implantation, but has the precision to read from and write to 16 independent channels within a 16mm3 volume of neural tissue within 50ms. Each channel is capable of specifically interacting with sub-millimeter regions of the brain with a spatial and temporal specificity that rivals existing invasive approaches. Individual devices can be combined to provide the ability to interface to multiple points in the brain at once. To enable future non-invasive brain-machine interfaces, N3 researchers are working to develop solutions that address challenges such as the physics of scattering and weakening of signals as they pass through skin, skull, and brain tissue, as well as designing algorithms for decoding and encoding neural signals that are represented by other modalities such as light, acoustic, or electro-magnetic energy. |/news-events/n3-proposers-day.html,N3 Proposers Day;/news-events/2019-05-20.html,Six Paths to the Nonsurgical Future of Brain-Machine Interfaces;/news-events/2018-03-16.html,Nonsurgical Neural Interfaces Could Significantly Expand Use of Neurotechnology;/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;/about-us/timeline/the-mother-of-all-demos.html,Mother of all Demos

By leveraging and combining emerging technologies in swarm autonomy and human-swarm teaming, the program seeks to enable rapid development and deployment of breakthrough capabilities. OFFSET aims to provide the tools to quickly generate swarm tactics, evaluate those swarm tactics for effectiveness, and integrate the best swarm tactics into field operations. To accomplish these goals, OFFSET will develop an active swarm tactics development ecosystem and supporting open systems architecture, including: An advanced human-swarm interface to enable users to monitor and direct potentially hundreds of unmanned platforms simultaneously in real time. The program intends to leverage rapidly emerging immersive and intuitive interactive technologies (e.g., augmented and virtual reality, voice-, gesture-, and touch-based) to create a novel command interface with immersive situational awareness and decision presentation capabilities. The interface would also incorporate a swarm interaction grammar, enabling “freestyle” design of swarm tactics that allow dynamic action and reaction based on real-time conditions in the field. A real-time, networked virtual environment that would support a physics-based, swarm tactics game. In the game, players would use the interface to rapidly explore, evolve, and evaluate swarm tactics to see which would potentially work best, whether using various unmanned systems in the real world or exploring innovative synthetic technologies in the virtual one. Users could submit swarm tactics and track their performance from test rounds on a leaderboard, to encourage both competition and collaboration. A community-driven swarm tactics exchange. This curated, limited access program portal would house tools to help participants design swarm tactics by composing collective behaviors, swarm algorithms, and even other existing tactics. It would provide these key ingredients to an extensible architecture for end-user-generated swarm tactics and help create a lasting community to innovate and cultivate the most effective tactics, with the potential to integrate third-party tactics and future users. OFFSET is structured to demonstrate its technologies through frequent live experiments with various unmanned air and ground platforms. Roughly every six months, operational vignettes of progressively increasing complexity would challenge both the swarm architecture and the developed swarm tactics across numerous technological and operational test variables, such as swarm size, spatial scale of operations, and mission duration. Users would employ the swarm interface to test the best of the virtual tactics in the real world, and interactively supply their unmanned platforms with near-real-time tactics updates using automated deployment technologies.  |/news-events/offset-proposers-day.html,OFFSET Proposers Day;/news-events/2021-12-09.html,OFFSET Swarms Take Flight in Final Field Experiment;/news-events/2020-09-18.html,Teams Demonstrate Swarm Tactics in Fourth Major OFFSET Field Experiment;/news-events/2020-04-13.html,OFFSET Awards Contracts to Advance Swarm Tactics for Urban Missions, Enhance Physical Testbeds;/news-events/2019-08-07.html,Teams Test Swarm Autonomy in Second Major OFFSET Field Experiment

IoT devices are often sensors, and 5G access to their data is envisioned to play important roles in medicine, manufacturing, and smart cities.Standards processes are used to maintain interoperability required for a public network, and while many of the components and component behaviors of 5G have changed little from predecessors, such as 4G and LTE, the standards for the most futuristic 5G features are those most in flux. These futuristic features, ranging from network slicing to support for programmable networks, also present the greatest risk to U.S. national security, as networks are simultaneously critical infrastructure and the means used for cyberespionage and cyberwarfare.DARPA’s Open, Programmable, Secure 5G (OPS-5G) aims to address this risk by pursuing research leading to the development of a portable standards-compliant network stack for 5G mobile that is open source and secure by design. OPS-5G seeks to create open source software and systems that enable secure 5G and subsequent mobile networks such as 6G. The signature security advantage of open source software is increased code visibility, meaning that code can be examined, analyzed, and audited, either manually or with automated tools. In addition, the portability of open source serves, as a desired side-effect, to decouple the hardware and software ecosystems. This significantly raises the difficulty of a supply-chain attack and eases the introduction of innovative hardware into the market. The program seeks to enable a “plug-and-play” approach to various software components which reduces reliance on untrusted technology sources.Programmable networks bring new flexibility to 5G, but also introduce novel security challenges.  To achieve 5G’s potential benefits, programmability must be implemented and managed carefully. Such benefits include bespoke networks that are tuned to application needs, as well as increased network adaptation capabilities. Programmability must also be developed in ways that avoid rampant opportunities for misuse. Ideally, the introduction of programmability for 5G will incorporate lessons learned from the well-intentioned introduction of programmability into web browsers, a capability that quickly became weaponized by malicious actors. OPS-5G aims to improve overall 5G security by increasing trust at a set of soft points that include unmanaged, unattended, long-lived, and possibly long-forgotten IoT devices. Additionally, OPS-5G aims to address unintended and unwanted interactions between network slices and threats from the vast increases in network scale.More information is available in the OPS-5G BAA. |/news-events/2020-02-05.html,Improving 5G Network Security;/news-events/2021-11-02.html,Episode 51: The Cybersecurity Sleuth;/news-events/2021-03-08.html,DARPA Selects Researchers to Accelerate Use of Fully Homomorphic Encryption;/news-events/2020-09-23.html,Episode 33: The Verification Virtuoso;/news-events/2020-03-02.html,Building Hardware to Enable Continuous Data Protections

It will also seek to develop methods for extending quantum advantage on limited size processors to large combinatorial optimization problems via techniques such as problem decomposition.   |/news-events/optimization-with-noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum-devices-proposers-day.html,Optimization with Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices (ONISQ) Proposers Day;/news-events/2020-05-11a.html,DARPA Kicks Off  Program to Advance Quantum Computing;/news-events/2019-02-27.html,Taking the Next Step in Quantum Information Processing;/news-events/impaqt-webinar.html,Imagining Practical Applications for a Quantum Tomorrow (IMPAQT) Webinar;/news-events/2023-03-07.html,DARPA Seeks Input to Advance Hybrid Quantum/Classical Computers
Optomechanical Thermal Imaging (OpTIm) |Infrared (IR) detectors underpin a vast application space including night vision, battlefield surveillance, terrestrial and space imaging, biochemical fingerprinting, and non-invasive medical diagnosis. Current IR detectors fall in one of two categories &ndash; thermal sensors that detect IR radiation as heat, and photodetectors that convert IR radiation into electric current. While the former class of sensors can operate at room temperature, they are highly limited in their sensitivity and response time. In contrast, while IR photodetectors are capable of quantum-limited sensitivity, they require cryogenic cooling, which limits their widespread use.

Ionospheric measurement campaigns typically rely on ground-based instrumentation to characterize the ionosphere. Ouija will augment these ground-based measurements with in-situ measurements from space, in Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO), to develop and validate accurate near real-time HF propagation predictions. The VLEO altitude regime (approximately 200 km - 300 km) is of particular interest due to its information rich environment where ionospheric electron density is at a maximum. Fine-grained knowledge of the spatial-temporal characteristics of electron density at these altitudes is required for accurate HF propagation prediction.Ouija Technical Area-1 (TA-1) will develop, qualify, launch and operate multiple small satellites carrying scientific and mission instrumentation. The Ouija scientific payload will measure electron density by both direct sampling  and indirectly via radio occultation using navigation satellites. The HF mission payload will require a high sensitivity, high dynamic range, low noise HF measurement subsystem. The antenna for this subsystem is a particular challenge, as efficient HF antennas that operate at the lower end of the band are long, presenting deployment and space vehicle drag challenges.Ouija Technical Area-2 (TA-2) will develop assimilative models to ingest direct, in-situ, measurements of electron density and through the sensor high frequency (HF) tomographic measurements from a satellite in very low earth orbit. The derived electron density models will be fed into HF propagation code then validated with data measured on-orbit. The goal is to improve fidelity over current state-of-the-art assimilative models by incorporating high resolution (in time and space) local measures with low latency updates.The solicitation for Ouija Technical Area 2, including full technical details, program structure, and instructions for submitting a proposal, is available at the following link: https://sam.gov/opp/bb6c10279c794a07b1d0696e5e2ec6bd/viewA Proposers Day for Technical Area 2 is being held on Aug. 3, 2022.

The project aims to support both peacetime and wartime monitoring of high value targets in contested environments where resources and targets may be highly dynamic.Current practices require human operators for exquisite satellite solutions. This arrangement does not scale well for the numbers of targets that Oversight is considering. Reliance on individual ground station operators significantly increases latency and minimizes tactical utility of satellite sensor data. Oversight will develop the autonomy necessary to track targets with the operator overseeing at an aggregate level. It will also leverage existing and/or state-of-the-art networks to provide collaboration between satellite and ground resources. |/news-events/darpa-subterranean-challenge-final-event.html,DARPA Subterranean Challenge Final Event;/news-events/offset-proposers-day.html,OFFSET Proposers Day;/news-events/subt-challenge-proposers-day.html,SubT Challenge Proposers Day;/news-events/subterranean-challenge-competitors-day.html,Subterranean Challenge Competitors Day;/news-events/subterranean-challenge-tunnel-circuit.html,Subterranean Challenge Tunnel Circuit

If it succeeds, it will yield new drugs that address some of the challenging physical demands faced by warfighters, including metabolic stress — as with prolonged exertion at high altitude — and activity-related soft tissue injury and resultant pain and inflammation.Panacea is comprised of two major task areas that must operate collaboratively and in parallel. The first component requires researchers to use multi-omics techniques to generate deep molecular profiles of physiological states and determine high-value drug targets. The second component applies novel medicinal chemistry approaches to generate drugs that engage multiple protein targets simultaneously for greater therapeutic effectiveness. Panacea researchers are tasked with going from a de novo network representation of a specific indication to a first-in-class drug candidate with multiple predicted targets that outperforms current treatments for acute metabolic stress or pain/inflammation.  Panacea aims to generate a platform capability that enables rapid discovery of novel drug targets and to provide the means to synthesize molecules to effectively engage those targets. The platform could be extended to novel drug discovery for indications currently considered undruggable. The compounds produced in the Panacea program will represent a departure from traditional drug discovery pipelines, provide a paradigm shift to the means with which new drugs are produced, and increase the number of conditions that can be treated with drugs.  |/news-events/panacea-proposers-day.html,Panacea Proposers Day;/news-events/2018-11-28.html,Reinventing Drug Discovery and Development for Military Needs;/program/preemptive-expression-of-protective-alleles-and-response-elements.html,PReemptive Expression of Protective Alleles and Response Elements;https://sam.gov/opp/4f70483c0b4b49aeac299342a36af04d/view.html,Biological Technologies;/news-events/breakthrough-biological-technologies-for-national-security.html,Breakthrough Biological Technologies for National Security

P3 aims specifically to develop a scalable, adaptable, rapid response platform capable of producing relevant numbers of doses against any known or previously unknown infectious threat within 60 days of identification of such a threat in order to keep the outbreak from escalating and decrease disruptions to the military and homeland. State-of-the-art medical countermeasures often take many months or even years to develop, produce, distribute, and administer. The envisioned P3 platform would cut response time to weeks and stay within the window of relevance for containing an outbreak.P3 focuses on rapid discovery, characterization, production, testing, and delivery of efficacious DNA- and RNA-encoded medical countermeasures, a foundational technology pioneered by DARPA under the Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program that provides the body with instructions on how to immediately begin producing protective antibodies against a given threat. The P3 program seeks to unlock the potential of these coded genetic constructs—establishing them as the basis for a threat-agnostic platform technology—by achieving and integrating breakthroughs in three key areas: novel approaches for the growth of viruses for use in testing and evaluation of countermeasures; rapid identification and maturation of protective antibodies to increase their potency; and novel technologies for the delivery of nucleic acid constructs into patients to encode the antibody of interest and produce a protective response.A principal benefit of the nucleic-acid-based approach to limiting the spread of infection is that genetic constructs introduced into the body would process quickly and not integrate into an individual’s genome. Similarly, the antibodies produced in response to treatment would only be present in the body for weeks to months. This is consistent with DARPA's intent to safely deliver transient immunity, halting the spread of disease by creating a firewall, and buying time for longer-term medical responses to be developed and deployed. |/news-events/2020-11-10.html,DARPA’s Early Investment in COVID-19 Antibody Identification Producing Timely Results;/program/preemptive-expression-of-protective-alleles-and-response-elements.html,PReemptive Expression of Protective Alleles and Response Elements;/staff/dr-shannon-greene.html,Dr. Shannon Greene;/news-events/advanced-acclimation-and-protection-tool-for-environmental-readiness-proposers-day.html,ADvanced Acclimation and Protection Tool for Environmental Readiness (ADAPTER) Proposers Day;/news-events/pandemic-prevention-platform-east-coast-proposers-day.html,Pandemic Prevention Platform (P3) East Coast Proposers Day

PTG seeks to develop methods, techniques, and technology for artificially intelligent assistants that provide just-in-time visual and audio feedback to help with task execution. The goal is to provide users of PTG assistants with wearable sensors (head-mounted cameras and microphones) that allow the assistant to see what they see and hear and what they hear, and augmented reality (AR) headsets that allow assistants to provide feedback through speech and aligned graphics. The target assistants will learn about tasks relevant to the user by ingesting knowledge from checklists, illustrated manuals, training videos, and other sources of information. They will then combine this task knowledge with a perceptual model of the environment to support mixed-initiative and task-focused user dialogs. The dialogs will assist a user in completing a task, identifying and correcting an error during a task, and instructing them through a new task, taking into consideration the user’s level of expertise.For additional information, see the PTG BAA. |/news-events/perceptually-enabled-task-guidance-proposers-day.html,Perceptually-enabled Task Guidance (PTG) Proposers Day;/news-events/2023-01-25.html,VIDEO: A New Generation of AI Assistants  ;/news-events/2021-03-03.html,Developing Virtual Partners to Assist Military Personnel;/program/serial-interactions-in-imperfect-information-games-applied-to-complex-military-decision-making.html,Serial Interactions in Imperfect Information Games Applied to Complex Military Decision Making ;/staff/dr-jonathan-odom.html,Dr. Jonathan Odom

The program will tap into marine organisms’ innate abilities to sense and respond to perturbations in their environments and apply those abilities to the detection, characterization, and reporting of manned or unmanned underwater vehicles ranging from small autonomous vessels to large nuclear submarines. Because marine organisms are ubiquitous in their environments, self-replicating, and largely self-sustaining, sensing systems that use marine organisms as their foundation would be discreet, cost-effective, and provide persistent undersea surveillance with a minimal logistical footprint.   The envisioned PALS system would work in two stages. In the first stage, marine organisms would sense the presence of an underwater vehicle (or confounder) in their environment and respond with an output signal or other observable behavior. In the second stage, a man-made detector system would observe, record, and interpret the organisms’ response, and transmit analyzed results to remote end users as distilled alerts. The complete PALS system would also discriminate between target vehicles and other sources of stimuli, such as debris and other marine organisms, to limit the number of false positives. By teaming marine organisms with distributed detection systems, PALS aims to greatly extend the lifetime and range of undersea surveillance capabilities. |/news-events/2020-09-28.html,DARPA’s PALS Program Enters Second Phase;/news-events/2019-02-15.html,Five Teams of Researchers Will Help DARPA Detect Undersea Activity by Analyzing Behaviors of Marine Organisms;/news-events/2018-02-02.html,PALS Turns to Marine Organisms to Help Monitor Strategic Waters;https://sam.gov/opp/4f70483c0b4b49aeac299342a36af04d/view.html,Biological Technologies;/staff/dr-catherine-campbell.html,Dr. Catherine Campbell

Most importantly, the program will leverage molecular components or commensal organisms at key points of vulnerability to remove protective equipment burden from the user. Successful PPB technologies would therefore change how the military and public health communities perform in unpredictable threat environments. |/news-events/2021-04-19,DARPA Selects Teams to Defend Against Chemical, Biological Threats from Inside and Out;/news-events/personalized-protective-biosystem-proposers-day,Personalized Protective Biosystem (PPB) Proposers Day;/news-events/2023-03-23,Concrete in Disrepair?

Increasingly, system performance in these domains is constrained not by the limits of computation at individual nodes, but by electrical data movement between individual chips. The Photonics in the Package for Extreme Scalability (PIPES) program is using light to vastly improve the digital connectivity of packaged integrated circuits, with a goal of enabling revolutionary performance gains through parallelism and modularity. PIPES seeks to embed optical signaling technologies within the package of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to enable data links with unprecedented bandwidth density, efficiency, and reach. Specifically, PIPES aims to integrate state-of-the-art electronics with photonic modules that deliver 100 Tbps per package at energies less than 1 picojoule per bit, while creating technologies capable of 10x higher performance for future applications.  As PIPES technologies mature, DARPA anticipates pervasive adoption of embedded optics for signaling in advanced microelectronic systems. Beyond FPGAs and specialty DoD products, photonic connectivity for central processing units (CPUs), graphical processing units (GPUs), and domain-specific accelerators will impact a host of dual-use applications, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, large scale emulation, and high performance computing. |/news-events/2020-03-25.html,PIPES Researchers Demonstrate Optical Interconnects to Improve Performance of Digital Microelectronics;/news-events/2020-03-16.html,Researchers Selected to Pursue Photonic Signaling for Microelectronics System Scalability;/news-events/proposers-day-for-modular-optical-apertures-building-blocks-program.html,Proposers Day for Modular Optical Apertures Building Blocks (MOABB) Program;/news-events/2022-01-27.html,DARPA Researchers Use Light on Chip to Drive Next-Generation RF Platforms;/news-events/2021-10-12.html,Episode 50: The Photonicist

Through a nascent discipline known as proof engineering, DARPA seeks to create higher levels of assurance that will help critical DOD software systems remain free of certain classes of defects and vulnerabilities. Proof engineering will help developers construct software safely and ensure the software meets specified assurance requirements. DARPA’s Pipelined Reasoning of Verifiers Enabling Robust Systems (PROVERS) program will develop formal methods tools to guide software engineers through designing proof-friendly software systems and reduce the proof repair workload. PROVERS builds off the Proof Engineering, Adaptation, Repair, and Learning for Software (PEARLS) AI Exploration project, which demonstrated how AI and machine learning could support and automate the generation and maintenance of proofs used in the formal verification of software at large scale.  The goal of PROVERS is to make formal methods accessible to non-experts (e.g., traditional software developers and systems engineers) while minimizing the impact on their existing processes and performance. Furthermore, the tooling would integrate into a development pipeline enabling a continuous flow of capabilities over time while maintaining high levels of assurance.PROVERS is a 42-month program spanning three phases that encompasses proof engineering, platform development, a red team to emulate potential adversaries’ attacks, and a separate federally funded research and development center to provide quantitative evaluation and evidence curation.More information on this program is available via the Special Notice at https://sam.gov/opp/bcf34cd2d80f4a109c5c15b75ed2063d/view.A Broad Agency Announcement solicitation with all program details and instructions for submitting proposals is available on SAM.gov at this link: https://sam.gov/opp/ccee3b24b035414caa7e3a6357ce9716/viewEditor’s Note: Updated on March 29, 2023 to include the Broad Agency Announcement link. |/news-events/2023-03-27.html,Show Us the Proof: Formal Methods Can Be Applied at Large Scale;https://sam.gov/opp/ccee3b24b035414caa7e3a6357ce9716/view.html,Pipelined Reasoning Of Verifiers Enabling Robust Systems (PROVERS);/news-events/2019-07-02.html,Automating the Software Sustainment Loop;/program/intent-defined-adaptive-software.html,Intent-Defined Adaptive Software;/program/proof-engineering-adaptation-repair-and-learning-for-software.html,Proof Engineering, Adaptation, Repair, and Learning for Software

However, engineering productivity has not kept pace with Moore's Law, leading to prohibitive increases in development costs and team sizes for leading-edge SoC design. To help manage the complexity of SoC development, design reuse in the form of Intellectual Property (IP) modules has become the primary strategy. IP modules are pre-designed, functional circuit blocks that are similar in nature to software library functions and are developed internally by an organization or procured from an external, third-party IP vendor. Defense systems today may leverage over a hundred unique IP blocks, which creates significant productivity improvements but also limits visibility into the final SoC’s behavior and offers no clear path for complete security or integrity verification due to schedule and cost pressures. Further, the single layer point-to-point approach associated with the current IP licensing model limits the scope of reuse and abstraction. A candidate approach for creating a deeply layered, transparent SoC development model is to draw from best practices in the software community and leverage open source hardware IP. However, the idea of reusing the open source IP available today has not seen wide adoption due to the high cost of failure, limited capabilities, and inability to prove functionality prior to adoption. To help address the current design complexity challenges, the Posh Open Source Hardware (POSH) program seeks to enable mathematically provable secure electronics and create an open source hardware IP ecosystem, along with accompanying validation tools. Under the program, researchers will work to develop methodologies, standards, and simulation as well as emulation technologies for the verification and mathematical inspection of analog and digital IP to provide proof of functionality and security.

Despite investment in the development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) to address these threats, many existing MCMs suffer from limited applicability, insufficient efficacy, requirements for repeat dosing, lengthy and complex manufacturing processes, and logistically burdensome storage requirements. In many cases, unique threats require unique responses, setting up a “one threat, one MCM” paradigm. These limitations make it extraordinarily difficult to treat the large numbers of individuals who could be impacted by the outcomes of a natural disaster, accident, pandemic outbreak, or directed attack in a heavily populated area. The PReemptive Expression of Protective Alleles and Response Elements (PREPARE) program aims to develop a new approach by identifying innate host genetic defenses against threats and developing novel MCMs that can quickly activate and modulate these genes to boost protection—without altering the underlying genetic code. The programmable, gene-modulating MCMs DARPA envisions are intended to provide timely and robust protection against a broad range of threats; however, within the PREPARE program, research teams will seek to demonstrate proof of concept by addressing three major threat areas: influenza infection, organophosphate poisoning, and exposure to gamma irradiation.PREPARE researchers will apply new insights from the fields of genome editing and in vivo delivery to develop safe, programmable, and transient treatments that precisely tune the activity of protective genes to preemptively activate and strengthen a host’s intrinsic defenses. Work on the program will identify and validate protective genes; develop novel MCMs capable of specific and multiplexable control of endogenous protective genes; and create methods to enable tissue-specific, in vivo delivery of programmable MCMs to confer protection in healthy animal models for relevant durations. The integration of these aims will support a capability to generate programmable, gene-modulating MCMs with a path towards clinical translation. |/news-events/preemptive-expression-of-protective-alleles-and-response-elements-proposers-day.html,PReemptive Expression of Protective Alleles and Response Elements (PREPARE) Proposers Day;/news-events/2019-06-27.html,A Dose of Inner Strength to Survive and Recover from Potentially Lethal Health Threats;/news-events/2018-05-25.html,Dialing Up the Body’s Defenses Against Public Health and National Security Threats;/news-events/2020-11-10.html,DARPA’s Early Investment in COVID-19 Antibody Identification Producing Timely Results;/program/pandemic-prevention-platform.html,Pandemic Prevention Platform

Such tools provide a level of assurance not possible through testing alone. However, analysis has been hampered by the limited size and complexity of problems that can be addressed, and the highly specialized skills needed to exercise formal verification tools. As a result, the ability to objectively determine that software contains no flaws, with respect to a specification, is very limited. Moreover, any attempt to update or maintain the software can invalidate a formal proof, requiring significant effort to repair the proofs. The Proof Engineering, Adaptation, Repair, and Learning for Software (PEARLS) AI Exploration topic seeks novel methods of developing formal proofs that can be trained on limited data to significantly improve formal proof construction, evolution, or repair. As scalable proof repair techniques are developed, proofs would be integrated into the normal software development process with the need for formal methods expertise being limited to the most difficult cases. Then existing proof technologies could be applied in many more software engineering contexts in support of critical DOD national security systems using a comparable effort of maintaining a proof to that of maintaining the software. Moderate code changes would result in moderate – and automated – proof repairs.For more information, see the PEARLS Program Announcement.|/news-events/2023-03-27.html,Show Us the Proof: Formal Methods Can Be Applied at Large Scale;/news-events/2019-07-02.html,Automating the Software Sustainment Loop;/program/intent-defined-adaptive-software.html,Intent-Defined Adaptive Software;/program/pipelined-reasoning-of-verifiers-enabling-robust-systems.html,Pipelined Reasoning of Verifiers Enabling Robust Systems;https://sam.gov/opp/bcf34cd2d80f4a109c5c15b75ed2063d/view.html,Pipelined Reasoning of Verifiers Enabling Robust Systems (PROVERS) Proposers Day

For many of these examples, like quantum chemistry and protein structure prediction, quantum computers are hypothesized to be useful simulators because the target problem is inherently quantum mechanical. Other examples, like classification and nonlinear dynamics, center around problems that have nothing to do with quantum systems, but involve combinatorial complexity that is intractable for conventional computers.  For each of the fields listed above, it is unclear exactly what size, quality, and configuration of quantum computer – if any – will enable the hypothesized revolutionary advances.

Quantum networks could mitigate these vulnerabilities and protect data by using quantum properties. The challenge, however, is that today’s various quantum implementations lack cohesion, resulting in systems that can’t work together.

These innovations form the basis of a new wave of Signal Processing technologies to address performance limitations of conventionally designed radio frequency (RF) systems such as radar, signals intelligence, electronic warfare, and communications. Over the last decade ML has been applied successfully to numerous sensor modalities, and is now common place in many commercial applications, including object and facial recognition in images, speech recognition in acoustic signals, and text parsing and reasoning from documents.  Key to each of these innovations was the evolution from hand-engineered approaches tailored to each problem, to solutions that learned from large datasets. RF systems conversely are still designed using models and equations based on idealized assumptions and approximations regarding hardware, environment, and the problem being solved.  The inaccuracy of these assumptions challenge our ability to perform tasks such as identification of signals among the ever-increasing myriad which populate the wireless landscape. Under the program, RFMLS systems will seek to learn to perform four specific tasks.  Each task emphasizes a core constituent capability of RF ML.  The four solutions can be combined and applied to address DoD operational needs in the RF Spectrum.  RF Fingerprinting.  Traditional wireless security relies on a software “identity” for each wireless device, which can often be hacked or otherwise cloned. The RFMLS system will aim to learn to recognize a specific transmitter based on the unique RF fingerprint naturally imparted by hardware imperfections within that transmitter.  This task focuses on learning RF features.  RF Fingerprint Enhancement.  To further enhance wireless security, a communication system learns to modify it’s transmit waveforms to enhance its natural fingerprint.  This task focuses on learning to synthesize waveforms. Spectrum Awareness.  Traditional systems which monitor the RF spectrum use narrow bandwidths and relatively simple strategies (such as the frequency of transmission) to identify the signals occupying the wireless spectrum.  Availability of commodity analog-to-digital converters with wide bandwidths combined with proliferation of software defined radios, spectrum sharing, and general wireless technology growth, challenge these approaches.  RFMLS systems will learn to understand the difference between important and unimportant signals present in large bandwidths in order to build more useful and accurate spectrum awareness.  This task emphasizes goal-driven attention. Autonomous RF System Configuration.  To further enhance spectrum awareness performance, a RFMLS system will seek to learn how best to tune and configure its hardware resources in order to maximize the number of important signals discovered in harsh RF environments.  This task stresses hardware configuration and control.   |/news-events/2017-12-21a.html,Preliminary Round of DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge Awards Ten Teams ;/news-events/2017-08-11a.html,The Radio Frequency Spectrum + Machine Learning = A New Wave in Radio Technology;/news-events/resilient-networked-distributed-mosaic-communications-proposers-day.html,Resilient Networked Distributed Mosaic Communications (RN DMC) Proposers Day;/news-events/spectrum-collaboration-challenge.html,Spectrum Collaboration Challenge;/news-events/spectrum-collaboration-challenge-sc2.html,Spectrum Collaboration Challenge

In recent years, the ability to learn from large datasets has advanced significantly due to increases in hardware performance, advances in machine learning (ML) algorithms, and the availability of high quality open datasets. However, current ML systems are generally trained prior to deployment and are not capable of adapting to new datasets in the field, limiting real-time “learning.” Critical next-generation defense systems, such as autonomous vehicles and arrays of sensors, will be deployed in distributed settings where resources for exporting newly encountered data might be scarce or unavailable. The Real Time Machine Learning (RTML) program seeks to solve this problem by creating no-human-in-the-loop hardware generators and compilers to enable the fully automated creation of ML Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) from high-level source code. The RTML program is focused on building an end-to-end general purpose compiler that can transform a high level ML framework into Verilog. This, in turn, may allow future engineers to rapidly develop and deploy large-scale real-time machine learning systems with customized hardware that can execute intensive ML algorithmic tasks on chip, without the need for external computational resources.  |/news-events/real-time-machine-learning-proposers-day.html,Real Time Machine Learning (RTML) Proposers Day;/news-events/2019-03-21.html,Designing Chips for Real Time Machine Learning;/news-events/artificial-intelligence-colloquium.html,Artificial Intelligence Colloquium;/news-events/knowlege-directed-artificial-intelligence-reasoning-over-schemas-proposers-day.html,Knowledge-directed Artificial Intelligence Reasoning Over Schemas (KAIROS) Proposers Day;/news-events/2018-12-10.html,Bringing Advanced Microelectronics to Revolutionary Defense Applications
Reconfigurable Imaging (ReImagine) |Today&rsquo;s imaging systems primarily perform a single or limited set of measurements due, in large part, to the underlying readout integrated circuits (ROICs), which sample the signal of interest and transfer the values off of the chip.

ROICs are currently designed for a specific mode of operation and are, effectively, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs).The Reconfigurable Imaging (ReImagine) program seeks to demonstrate that a software-reconfigurable imaging system is capable of enabling revolutionary capabilities. The goals of the program are to create a new approach to application development that is more similar to field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based design than ASIC design, and develop the underlying theory and algorithms that learn to collect the most valuable information when the sensor can be configured for a variety of measurements. The ReImagine program aims to demonstrate that a single, reconfigurable ROIC architecture can accommodate multiple modes of imaging operations that may be defined after a chip has been designed.The ReImagine program takes advantage of 3-D integration, which makes it possible to interface with virtually any type of imaging sensor (e.g. photodiode, photoconductor, avalanche photodiode, or bolometer) and optimize it for any spectral band (e.g. ultraviolet (UV) through very long-wave infrared (VLWIR)). More importantly, this approach makes it possible to adapt the mode of operation either through manual user control, through preset routines that can change many times per second, or in response to context derived from the scene being observed. For example, a single imager could present simultaneous regions of interest (ROIs) that can run at different spatial or temporal resolutions or can run either active or passive.ReImagine ROICs will also demonstrate that efficient computation within an ROI can enable real-time analysis on much more complex scenes than traditional systems. The program will build on this architecture to develop a concept of operation, application requirements, modes of operation, and needed algorithms. The ReImagine ROICs could enable delivery of more actionable information to the warfighter than has ever been possible from a single imaging sensor. |/work-with-us/interact-with-dso.html,Interact with DSO;/work-with-us/what-is-our-current-investment-portfolio.html,What is our current investment portfolio?;https://sam.gov/opp/37ec023e75b64a69bc05236517a73578/view.html,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) RFI;https://sam.gov/opp/643088c8b2d84341ab92ce7ff00babee/view.html,Strategic Technology Office (STO) Office-wide;/news-events/aerial-dragnet.html,Aerial Dragnet

There is no mechanized capability to translate and route relevant parts of the software to experts, such as control engineers, in an appropriate form for them to effectively analyze the mathematical expressions. In contrast, malware analysis has become considerably automated with aspects, such as provenance and behavioral characterization, gaining considerable traction in recent years.Recent research demonstrates effective use of artificial intelligence (AI) translation techniques for tasks like mechanized symbolic differentiation and integration, in which going in one direction is relatively straightforward. Inverse problems like symbolic integration, however, are more challenging and require expert ingenuity in repeated recognition and application of patterns.Although programming mathematical models is not as straightforward as symbolic differentiation, it is still a relatively straightforward skill with massive quantities of available examples and broadly taught practices. Conversely, recovering a mathematical description of software, even when the function of the software is known, has defied automation.The Recovery of Symbolic Mathematics from Code (ReMath) Artificial Intelligence Exploration (AIE) program aims to discover whether a combination of recent advances in AI techniques, such as neural machine translation, sequence-to-sequence encoders, etc., can effectively recover mathematical structures implemented in software into their natural mathematical forms of symbolic expression. These techniques could improve the understanding of complex software and may enable future methods for analysis and testing of cyber physical systems.For more information, see the ReMath Program Announcement. |/news-events/artificial-intelligence-colloquium.html,Artificial Intelligence Colloquium;/news-events/2022-11-28.html,U.S. Cyber Command, DARPA Initiate Rapid Cyber Capability Prototyping and Integration Pilot ;/news-events/2022-10-24.html,DARPA’s CASTLE to Fortify Computer Networks;/news-events/2022-07-21.html,Voices from DARPA Podcast Episode 58: The Cryptoprivacist;/news-events/2022-06-03.html,DARPA’s ANSR to Improving Trustworthy AI

Separation is defined as the extraction of various elements sequentially, and coextraction is defined as the extraction of a specified list of elements simultaneously from a feedstock containing a mixture of elements with other constituents. Contemporary approaches such as pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy for recovering critical elements from e-waste are best suited to recover a large volume fraction component from the feedstock and are ill-suited to recover multiple low-volume fraction elements typically found in e-waste.  While it is theoretically possible to exploit a combination of physical, chemical, and functional properties for fractional recovery of critical elements, such approaches are limited by insufficient knowledge on chemistries that can work together at the point of disposal. DARPA’s Recycling at the Point of Disposal (RPOD) program aims to develop novel extraction chemistries and explore practical limits of yield, extraction efficiency, and purity to recover a selective list of critical elements from commercial and DoD e-waste, anddemonstrate the technology in a benchtop hardware prototype. If successful, the recovered stream from e-waste can minimize supply chain disruptions of critical elements sourced or processed abroad that are essential for high performance DoD hardware.  |/news-events/2022-06-10.html,Recovering Rare-Earth Elements from E-Waste;/news-events/artificial-intelligence-for-critical-mineral-assessment-competition.html,Artificial Intelligence for Critical Mineral Assessment Competition;/news-events/2022-12-16.html,DARPA Announces Winners of AI for Critical Mineral Assessment Competition ;/news-events/2022-10-06a.html,DARPA Names Teams to Develop Biotechnologies to Purify Critical Elements ;/news-events/2022-08-15.html,DARPA Critical Minerals Competition Uses AI to Accelerate Analytics

Under Reefense, custom wave-attenuating base structures will promote calcareous reef organism (coral or oyster) settlement and growth, which will enable the system to self-heal and keep pace with sea level rise over time. A system will be put in place that will also attract non-reef building organisms necessary to help maintain a healthy, growing system. Finally, adaptive biology (other than genetically modified organisms) will enable improved coral and oyster resilience against disease and temperature stress, to ensure compatibility with a changing environment.The Reefense strategy includes employing recent innovations in materials science, hydrodynamic modeling, adaptive biology, and multiple effectors to develop growing structures that are optimized to rapidly implement coastal defenses suited to a changing environment. By co-designing structures with biology such that they can be rapidly deployed to provide immediate protection and then persistently facilitate the growth of calcareous organisms, the protective Reefense structures will be rapidly enhanced by what would normally require decades of biological structure-building, but which can be achieved in a matter of months to years.  |/news-events/2022-06-15.html,DARPA Selects Teams to Develop Novel Hybrid Reef-Mimicking Structures;/news-events/2020-12-17.html,DARPA Launches Program to Mitigate Coastal Flooding, Erosion and Storm Damage;/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;/staff/dr-catherine-campbell.html,Dr. Catherine Campbell;/news-events/cornucopia-proposers-day.html,Cornucopia Proposers Day

Extensive global networks of private-sector vendors, commonly called “supply chains,” collaborate to provide these key resources, including precursor components and materials. The Resilient Supply-and-Demand Networks (RSDN) program adopts the phrase “supply-and-demand network” (SDN) in lieu of “supply chain” to emphasize that the strategic challenges are more extensive than the logistic challenges of delivering (“supplying”) materiel. SDNs are open, complex, evolving systems whose dynamics reflect the impact of both external factors (e.g., conflict, climate change) and internal behaviors (e.g., inventory management). These factors are often driven by the locally focused decisions of SDN participants themselves. The economic forces of globalization have historically emphasized SDN efficiency (cost and timeliness) over SDN resilience (response to shocks). SDN resilience is a characteristic of the SDN system as a whole. Resilience enhancements, therefore, require coordinated action among SDN participants, who may individually lack the incentive and discretion to undertake this complex process. SDNs are potential sources of strategic surprise for the DoD. Surprise in the context of SDNs is rarely beneficial. Key underlying sources of SDN surprise are:Imperfect knowledge of the current structure of the SDN itself;Difficulty in predicting different kinds of shocks from the wide landscape of threats and vulnerabilities; and, Difficulty in predicting changes in the SDN due to endogenous behavioral shifts, which can be amplified abruptly and dramatically through feedback effects.To expose and mitigate these sources of surprise, RSDN will develop novel information resources and practical analytical tools, including:Granular, up-to-date maps of SDNs, identifying individual providers (network nodes) and their specific trading relationships with each other (network edges);Augmentation of the basic network maps with detailed organizational features describing the nodes and detailed descriptions of the procurement relationships governing the edges;A broad and extensible set of analytical tools for exploring fragilities (threats and vulnerabilities) in SDNs; and,Techniques for stress testing SDNs by specifying and simulating their responses to exogenous shocks and endogenous feedback.Additional information is available in the RSDN BAA. |/staff/dr-mark-flood.html,Dr. Mark Flood	;/news-events/2019-05-21a.html,Making DoD’s Vast Logistics Enterprise More Resilient;/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;/program/ensuring-consistency-of-systemic-information.html,Ensuring Consistency of Systemic Information;/program/logx.html,LogX

Moreover, even when these complexity barriers are overcome, the impact of machine learning solutions are often mitigated by the high energy cost of training and operating the machine learning systems.In principle, both of these fundamental obstacles – exponentially growing complexity and energy inefficiency – might be overcome using high-coherence quantum annealers, which are a specific type of quantum computing technology.DARPA’s Reversible Quantum Machine Learning and Simulation (RQMLS) AIE opportunity aims to: (1) explore the fundamental limits of reversible quantum annealers; (2) quantitatively predict the computational utility of these systems for machine learning tasks in simulation, many-body physics, classification, optimization, and other fields; and (3) design experimental tests for these predictions that can be carried out on small-scale systems. If successful, these small-scale systems could be scaled to much larger, potentially transformative systems. |/news-events/impaqt-webinar.html,Imagining Practical Applications for a Quantum Tomorrow (IMPAQT) Webinar;/news-events/quantum-benchmarking-proposers-day.html,Quantum Benchmarking Proposers Day;/news-events/2023-03-07.html,DARPA Seeks Input to Advance Hybrid Quantum/Classical Computers;/news-events/2023-01-31a.html,DARPA Collaborates with Commercial Partners to Accelerate Quantum Computing;/news-events/2022-02-22.html,Are Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers on the Horizon?

Robotic Autonomy in Complex Environments with Resiliency (RACER) |In complex militarily-relevant settings, robotic vehicles have not autonomously demonstrated operationally relevant speed or adaptability.

At a minimum, the program goal is software performance to move off-road at speeds on par with a human driver. The self-driving car industry has made rapid advances via a vehicle platform-based, agile develop-test-develop-test model that has accumulated data to help train algorithms and refine approaches. Simulation-based development approaches use the same data for algorithm tuning. On-road autonomy algorithms operate in well-structured and highly predictable environments with limited obstacles. However, military off-road autonomy algorithms and capability development has lagged due to the challenging complexity of off-road terrain environments and need to travel in them at relevant speeds.While RACER seeks to leverage advances in on-road autonomy, the project is investigating innovative approaches that enable revolutionary progress in algorithms operating on systems rather than science or research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. RACER will demonstrate game-changing autonomous UGV mobility, focused on speed and resiliency, using a combination of simulation and advanced platforms. It tests algorithms in the field at DARPA-hosted experiments across the country on a variety of terrain. The program provides UGV platforms that research teams can use to develop autonomous software capabilities through repeated cycles of tests on unstructured off-road landscapes. Goals include not only autonomy algorithms, but also creation of simulation-based approaches and environments that will support rapid advancement of self-driving capabilities for future UGVs. |/news-events/2022-09-16.html,RACER’s Off-Road Autonomous Vehicles Teams Expand to a Second Course Location;/news-events/2022-01-13.html,RACER Revs Up for Checkered Flag Goal of High-Speed, Off-Road Autonomy;/news-events/2021-01-15.html,DARPA Project Drives Simulation Technology for Off-Road Unmanned Vehicles;/news-events/2020-10-07.html,DARPA Project Strives for Off-Road Unmanned Vehicles that React Like Humans ;/news-events/competency-aware-machine-learning-webcast-proposers-day.html,Competency-Aware Machine Learning (CAML) Webcast Proposers Day

Even fully functional satellites sometimes find their working lives cut short simply because they carry obsolete payloads—a frustrating situation for owners of assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. With no prospects for assistance once in orbit, satellites destined for GEO today are loaded with backup systems and as much fuel as can be accommodated, adding to their complexity, weight and cost. But what if help was just a service call away?DARPA’s Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites (RSGS) program intends to answer that question by developing technologies that would enable cooperative inspection and servicing in GEO and demonstrating those technologies on orbit within the next five years. Under the RSGS vision, a DARPA-developed modular toolkit, including hardware and software, would be joined to a privately developed spacecraft to create a commercially owned and operated robotic servicing vehicle (RSV) that could make house calls in space. By executing the RSGS program, DARPA seeks to:Demonstrate in or near GEO that a robotic servicing vehicle can perform safe, reliable, useful and efficient operations, with the flexibility to adapt to a variety of on-orbit missions and conditions Demonstrate satellite servicing mission operations on operational GEO satellites in collaboration with commercial and U.S. Government spacecraft operators  Support the development of a servicer spacecraft with sufficient propellant and payload robustness to enable dozens of missions over several years  |/news-events/robotic-servicing-of-geosynchronous-satellites-proposers-day.html,Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites (RSGS) Proposers Day;/news-events/2022-11-08.html,DARPA’s Robotic In-Space Mechanic Aces Tests, on Track for Launch;/news-events/2014-11-10.html,Phoenix Releases POD Interface Requirements as First Step toward Vision of “FedEx® to GEO” ;/news-events/2014-09-03.html,Wanted: Insights to Guide Creation of Robotic Satellite-Servicing Capabilities in Geostationary Earth Orbit;/news-events/2014-04-02.html,Phoenix Makes Strides in Orbital Robotics and Satellite Architecture Research

ROCkN has two Technical Areas (TA) based on different application domains. TA1 aims to develop small portable clocks that provide the time precision necessary for distributed coherent sensing and other applications in a robust package suitable for airborne or spaceborne platforms. TA2 aims to develop transportable clocks with month-long holdover of GPS-quality precise time and autonomous operation, with a view toward providing a local regional time scale on land or seaborne platforms. The common technical challenge is to provide the timing precision and holdover required while constrained by SWaP and environmental sensitivity requirements.If successful, ROCkN will transition recent advances in laboratory optical timing technologies out of the lab and toward devices operational in the field to enable order of magnitude improvements in DoD timing capabilities.  |/news-events/robust-optical-clock-network-proposers-day.html,Robust Optical Clock Network (ROCkN) Proposers Day;/news-events/2022-01-20.html,Providing GPS-quality timing accuracy without GPS;/news-events/2020-07-07.html,Episode 30: The Sensor Sorcerer;/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;/news-events/microsystems-technology-office-proposers-day.html,Microsystems Technology Office Proposers Day

For commonly-used electronic data formats, input validation is, at a minimum, a problem of scale whereby specifications of these formats comprise hundreds to thousands of pages. Input validation thus translates to thousands or more conditions to be checked against the input data before the data can be safely processed. Manually writing the code to parse and validate input, and then manually auditing whether that code implements all the necessary checks completely and correctly, does not scale. Moreover, manual parser coding and auditing typically fails even for electronic data formats specifically designed to be easier to perform such tasks, e.g., JSON and XML. A variety of critical vulnerabilities have been found in major parser implementations for these formats. Widely deployed mitigations against crafted input attacks include (a) trying to prevent the flow of untrusted data to vulnerable software; and (b) testing  software with randomized inputs to find and patch flaws that could be triggered by maliciously created inputs. Unfortunately, neither of these approaches offer security assurance guarantees.Mitigations for preventing the flow of untrusted data to vulnerable software, which can be implemented via network or host-based measures such as firewalls, application proxies, antivirus scanners, etc., neither remove the underlying vulnerability from the target, nor encode complete knowledge of document or message format internals. Attacker bypasses of such mitigations exploit incompleteness of the mitigations' understanding of the data format to exploit the still-vulnerable targets.The Safe Documents (SafeDocs) program will develop novel verified programming methodologies for building high assurance parsers for extant electronic data formats, and novel methodologies for comprehending, simplifying, and reducing these formats to their safe, unambiguous, verification-friendly subsets (“safe sub-setting”). SafeDocs will address the ambiguity and complexity obstacles that hinder the application of verified programming posed by extant electronic data formats. SafeDocs’ multi-pronged approach will combine:extracting the extant formats’ de facto syntax (including any non-compliant syntax deliberately accepted and substantially used in the wild);identifying a syntactically simpler subset of this syntax that yields itself to use in verified programming while preserving the format's essential functionality; andcreating software construction kits for building secure, verified parsers for this syntactically simpler subset, and high-assurance translators for converting extant instances of the format to this subset. The parser construction kits developed by SafeDocs will be usable by industry programmers who understand the syntax of electronic data formats but lack the theoretical background in verified programming. These tools will enable developers to construct verifiable parsers for new electronic data formats as well as extant ones. The tools will guide the syntactic design of new formats, by making verification-friendly format syntax easy to express, and vice versa.Additional information is available in the SafeDocs BAA. SafeDocs Tools Available TodayThe following tools can help software developers and cybersecurity/privacy researchers improve their organization’s security posture in handling electronic documents.

The common scientific challenge is to improve atomic coherence at room temperature. The associated technical challenges depend somewhat on the specifics of the most dominant decoherence mechanisms in each approach.

These critical productivity tools rely on internet-enabled, enterprise-wide communication systems to interconnect sites and create a global substrate to support their operation. While these applications have become increasingly vital for enterprises, approaches to specifying and controlling network quality of service (QoS) for them has not been deployed at scale. There are many reasons for this, including the complexity of decentralized resource control in a federated internet, and the demonstrated effectiveness of low-level Internet protocols such as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) in exploiting and sharing the available capacity amongst networked applications. The Searchlight program explores novel approaches to analysis and QoS management of an enterprise’s distributed applications overlaid on the internet. The goal of the program is to develop techniques and systems that enable an enterprise to temporarily decrease the QoS for low-priority application traffic internal to the organization, resulting in sufficient QoS for the organization’s high-priority traffic.

SIEVE will also focus on increasing the efficiency of ZK proof technology to enable large, complex proof statements (e.g., billions of gates or more, where the statement natively consists of probabilistic, indeterminate-branching conditions). SIEVE will demonstrate the feasibility of encoding complex, DoD-relevant statements into intermediate representations (IRs) that can then be used to create efficient ZK proofs for those statements.Additionally, in order to ensure the relevance of ZK proofs for the foreseeable future, including the case where a cryptographically-relevant quantum computer were to exist, SIEVE will focus on substantially decreasing the asymptotic complexity of post-quantum ZK proof techniques, specifically ZK proofs that 1) rely on post-quantum hardness assumptions for their security and/or 2) reason about statements of relevance to post-quantum cryptography. |/news-events/2022-07-21.html,Voices from DARPA Podcast Episode 58: The Cryptoprivacist;/program/programming-computation-on-encrypted-data.html,PROgramming Computation on EncryptEd Data ;/program/resilient-anonymous-communication-for-everyone.html,Resilient Anonymous Communication for Everyone;/program/safer-warfighter-communications.html,SAFER Warfighter Communications ;/program/safeware.html,SAFEWARE

Detection techniques that rely on statistical fingerprints can often be fooled with limited additional resources (algorithm development, data, or compute). However, existing automated media generation and manipulation algorithms are heavily reliant on purely data driven approaches and are prone to making semantic errors. For example, generative adversarial network (GAN)-generated faces may have semantic inconsistencies such as mismatched earrings. These semantic failures provide an opportunity for defenders to gain an asymmetric advantage. A comprehensive suite of semantic inconsistency detectors would dramatically increase the burden on media falsifiers, requiring the creators of falsified media to get every semantic detail correct, while defenders only need to find one, or a very few, inconsistencies.The Semantic Forensics (SemaFor) program seeks to develop innovative semantic technologies for analyzing media. These technologies include semantic detection algorithms, which will determine if multi-modal media assets have been generated or manipulated. Attribution algorithms will infer if multi-modal media originates from a particular organization or individual. Characterization algorithms will reason about whether multi-modal media was generated or manipulated for malicious purposes. These SemaFor technologies will help detect, attribute, and characterize  adversary disinformation campaigns.For more information, please see the SemaFor BAA.HR001119S0085: Proposers Day VideoHR001119S0085: Proposers Day SlidesHR001119S0085: FAQ |/news-events/2021-03-02.html,DARPA Announces Research Teams Selected to Semantic Forensics Program;/news-events/2019-09-03a.html,Uncovering the Who, Why, and How Behind Manipulated Media;/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence.html,Explainable Artificial Intelligence;/program/habitus.html,Habitus;/staff/dr-bartlett-russell.html,Dr. Bartlett Russell

Social Simulation for Evaluating Online Messaging Campaigns (SocialSim) |A rapidly increasing percentage of the world&rsquo;s population is connected to the global information environment.

At the same time, the information environment is enabling social interactions that are radically changing how and at what rate information spreads. Both nation-states and nonstate actors have increasingly drawn upon this global information environment to promote their beliefs and further related goals. A simulation of the spread and evolution of online information, if accurate and at-scale, could enable a deeper and more quantitative understanding of adversaries’ use of the global information environment than is currently possible using existing approaches. At present, the U.S. Government employs small teams of experts to speculate how information may spread online. While these activities provide some insight, they take considerable time to orchestrate and execute, the accuracy with which they represent real-world online behavior is unknown, and their scale (in terms of the size and granularity with which populations are represented) is such that they can represent only a fraction of the real world. High-fidelity (i.e., accurate, at-scale) computational simulation of the spread and evolution of online information would support efforts to analyze strategic disinformation campaigns by adversaries, deliver critical information to local populations during disaster relief operations, and could potentially contribute to other critical missions in the online information domain. The goal of Computational Simulation of Online Social Behavior (SocialSim) is to develop innovative technologies for high-fidelity computational simulation of online social behavior. SocialSim will focus specifically on information spread and evolution. Current computational approaches to social and behavioral simulation are limited in this regard. Top-down simulation approaches focus on the dynamics of a population as a whole, and model behavioral phenomena by assuming uniform or mostly-uniform behavior across that population. Such methods can easily scale to simulate massive populations, but can be inaccurate if there are specific, distinct variations in the characteristics of the population. In contrast, bottom-up simulation approaches treat population dynamics as an emergent property of the activities and interactions taking place within a diverse population. While such approaches can enable more accurate simulation of information spread, they do not readily scale to represent large populations. SocialSim aims to develop novel approaches to address these challenges. |/news-events/next-generation-social-science-proposers-day.html,Next Generation Social Science (NGS2) Proposers Day;/news-events/2016-03-04.html,Accelerating Discovery with New Tools and Methods for Next Generation Social Science ;/work-with-us/interact-with-dso.html,Interact with DSO;/work-with-us/what-is-our-current-investment-portfolio.html,What is our current investment portfolio?;/program/next-generation-social-science.html,Next Generation Social Science
Software Defined Hardware (SDH) |In modern warfare, decisions are driven by information.

That information can come in the form of thousands of sensors providing information, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) data; logistics/supply-chain and personnel performance measurements; or a host of other sources and formats. The ability to exploit this data to understand and predict the world around us is an asymmetric advantage for the Department of Defense (DoD).Utilizing this data relies on computational algorithms running at a huge scale. Today, developers are limited in their ability to run these algorithms efficiently because they generally have to trade the efficiency of their algorithms with that of the available hardware architecture implementations. To combat this challenge, one solution is to design and fabricate application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) — customized hardware designed to maximize the runtime efficiency of a specific algorithm. However, ASICs typically cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take many years to develop. Once developed, they can perform exactly one class of computation because they were designed and specialized for specific application tasks.  Because these systems are so specifically tailored and costly, their creation is often limited to the highest priority algorithms. For problems that cannot afford this level of investment, compute efficiency is sacrificed by implementing solutions such as software on general-purpose processors or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Often, this results in application implementations that are thousands of times worse than optimal. The goal of the Software Define Hardware (SDH) program is to build runtime-reconfigurable hardware and software that enables near ASIC performance without sacrificing programmability for data-intensive algorithms. Under the program, data-intensive algorithms are defined as machine learning and data science algorithms that process large volumes of data and are characterized by their usage of intense linear algebra, graph search operations, and their associated data-transformation operators. The SDH program aims to create hardware/software systems that allow data-intensive algorithms to run at near ASIC efficiency without the cost, development time, or single application limitations associated with ASICs. If successful, SDH will result in the ability to develop and run data-intensive, data-exploitation algorithms at very low cost, and, consequently, enable pervasive use of big-data solutions for a wide range of DoD applications including ISR, predictive logistics, decision support, and beyond.  SDH Program Concept and Structure The SDH program will create malleable hardware/software architectures that, unlike ASICs, allow an application to defer hardware configuration to runtime. SDH will enable 1) the optimization of code and hardware dynamically when input data change, and 2) the reuse of hardware for new problems and new algorithms to solve existing problems. In order to accomplish these objectives, SDH targets very fast hardware reconfiguration speeds and dynamic compilation.  If successful, SDH will be able to take advantage of data-dependent optimizations that even today’s ASICs cannot exploit.The SDH program will measure compute efficiency (in terms of giga-operations per watt (GOPs/Watt)). By the end of the program, it is expected that SDH systems to be at efficiencies within 5X of ASICs and 500-1000X better than CPU implementations with the same programmability as current NumPy/Python implementations.  |/news-events/electronics-resurgence-initiative-summit.html,Electronics Resurgence Initiative Summit;/news-events/2021-12-22.html,DARPA Joins Public-Private Partnership to Address Challenges Facing Microelectronics Advancement;/news-events/2020-06-17.html,DARPA Announces Third-Annual Electronics Resurgence Initiative Summit & MTO Symposium;/news-events/2019-05-31.html,DARPA Announces ERI Summit 2019 Workshops;/news-events/2019-04-05.html,DARPA Announces Second Annual ERI Summit

In simpler terms, the goal of this program is to eliminate stovepipes and “connect space,” which will in turn enable the joint all-domain fight.  Space-BACN aims to overcome the perpetual lack of full on-orbit interoperability with current and future space communications.  Since proliferated space is so new, there is no standardization of communications or OISLs in this domain. New constellations that are in different stages of acquisition are procuring single-waveform cross-link communication systems that meet their mission’s or business objective’s particular needs to interconnect their own constellation. These single-waveform systems are only capable of talking to other systems that support that particular waveform, almost exclusively consist of custom-made components, and have little to no reconfigurability. While most waveforms operate within the same wavelength band, they differ in essentially all implementation details, including specific wavelengths, polarization, clock rate, spatial acquisition sequence, modulation format, framing, and error correction coding.  With each constellation acquiring its own single-waveform OISL, the space domain has become severely fragmented with isolated islands of connectivity.  Space-BACN’s multi-standard optical terminal that can be reconfigured on-orbit will enable communications across different standards, and connect these otherwise isolated constellations.To learn more about the Space-BACN program, visit the program webpage here: https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/space-based-adaptive-communications-node |/news-events/2022-08-10.html,DARPA Kicks Off Program to Develop Low-Earth Orbit Satellite ‘Translator’;/news-events/2021-09-13.html,Adaptable Optical Communications to Facilitate Future Low-Earth Orbit Networks;/work-with-us/space-based-adaptive-communications-node.html,Space-Based Adaptive Communications Node (Space-BACN);/news-events/confers-proposers-day.html,CONFERS Proposers Day;/news-events/darpa-launch-challenge.html,DARPA Launch Challenge

The program endeavors to accomplish this through enhancing cognitive flexibility (CF) and emotional regulation (ER), key behavioral health mechanisms that act as protective buffers against traumatic stress. CF refers to the mental ability to switch between thinking about two different concepts according to the context of a situation. ER is a conscious or nonconscious strategy to start, stop, or otherwise modulate the trajectory of an emotion. STRENGTHEN will strive to enhance the mental protective mechanisms of CF and ER through two goals: (1) Development of individualized brain network models of CF and ER and (2) design of multimodal, multidimensional interventions to induce neuroplastic change in the functional connectivity and/or structure of CF and ER brain networks to optimize an individual’s CF and ER.1 High Suicide Rates among United States Service Members and Veterans of the Post9/11 Wars, Thomas Howard Suitt, III, Boston University, June 2021|/news-events/2022-11-15.html,DARPA Seeks Novel Approaches to Improve Mental Health, Prevent Suicide;/news-events/2016-10-26.html,Neuroscience of Touch Supports Improved Robotic and Prosthetic Interfaces;/program/hand-proprioception-and-touch-interfaces.html,Hand Proprioception and Touch Interfaces ;/news-events/2022-04-04.html,Episode 55: Sensorized Prosthetics;/news-events/2020-11-09.html,DARPA Awards Contracts for Work on Spinal Cord Injury Treatment

If successful, this paradigm shift will overcome existing limitations and enable the collection of detailed part-level performance data in service.|/news-events/2017-09-07,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;/news-events/2022-10-05,DARPA Seeks Innovators to Accelerate Pace of Scientific Discovery;/news-events/2022-08-31,DARPA Unveils New Program to Recruit Early Career Scientists, Engineers;/news-events/2015-09-14,Reducing Complexity: DARPA Seeks New Composite Material and Process for Manufacturing Small Parts;/ARC,Advanced Research Concepts (ARC)

These systems and platforms integrate cyber and physical subsystems, and the enormous complexity of the resulting CPS has made their engineering design a daunting challenge. An immediate consequence of this complexity is development cycles with prolonged timelines that challenge DoD’s ability to counter emerging threats.CPS design is a complex endeavor that involves many domains  – from cyber (e.g., software, control, computing, and communication) to physical (e.g., structural, mechanical, thermal, etc.) to manufacturing – and upwards of hundreds of domain-specific tools orchestrated by large teams of engineers with extensive domain knowledge and subject matter expertise. Current engineering design processes start with requirements-driven decomposition into discipline-specific design flows that, at their core, are concurrently running sequential decision-making processes that involve generating candidate architectures; evaluating, selecting, and refining options; and integrating the design until requirements are satisfied. The goal of the Symbiotic Design for CPS (SDCPS) program is to develop AI-based approaches to enable correct-by-construction design of military-relevant CPS. SDCPS seeks to reduce the time from CPS inception to deployment from years to months, and enhance innovation in design. To accomplish this, SDCPS will address the following three intrinsic challenges: Predictability – The soundness of design decisions relies on accurate predictions of performance prior to the implementation of software and physical components. However, accurate predictions require high-fidelity models that are cost- and time-prohibitive to produce. Cost-effective modeling processes produce results with substantial uncertainty.Convergence – Design teams are federated according to discipline boundaries. However, separation of concerns within a complex system neglects the interdependence of design decisions, rendering rapid convergence to a viable integrated solution practically impossible. Exploration – Limited by time and resources, engineers have to make tradeoffs that constrain the exploration of the design space to the familiar and known-feasible. This leaves vast areas of design space unexplored, which may contain unconventional but highly performant solutions.The vision of the program is to vastly expand coverage and accelerate exploration of CPS design spaces with the symbiosis of two very different kinds of agents: humans with their uncanny ability to create intuitive associations across design domains, and machines with their ability to recognize statistical patterns from data and navigate vast search spaces for optimal solutions. The program aims to realize this vision by transforming the human-focused model-based design flows used today into a symbiotic process of collaborative discovery by humans and continuously learning AI-based co-designers.

Current efforts to protect electronic systems, however, rely on developing and deploying patches to the software layer, without addressing underlying vulnerabilities in the hardware. |https://www.darpa.mil/JSON/program/ssith.json|MTO|Dr. Lok Yan|/staff/dr-lok-yan.html|Cyber,Cyber,/tag-list.html?tag=Cyber;Electronics,Electronics and Microchips,/tag-list.html?tag=Electronics;Security,Physical Security,/tag-list.html?tag=Security|Electronic systems have become a critical part of daily life. Due to increased proliferation and reliance on these systems, their security is paramount to the Department of Defense (DoD), commercial industry, and beyond. Current efforts to protect electronic systems, however, rely on developing and deploying patches to the software layer, without addressing underlying vulnerabilities in the hardware.The System Security Integration Through Hardware and Firmware (SSITH) program seeks to protect electronic systems from common means of exploitation. Instead of relying on patches to ensure the safety of software applications, SSITH aims to address the underlying hardware vulnerabilities at the source. The program is developing hardware security architectures and associated design tools to protect systems against entire classes of vulnerabilities exploited through software, not just specific vulnerability instances. SSITH is focusing specifically on common classes of hardware weaknesses as identified by the MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration Specification (CWE) and NIST, including buffer errors; information leakage; resource management; numeric errors; injection; permissions, privileges, and access control; and hardware/system-on-chip implementation errors. Researchers are exploring a number of different approaches that go well beyond patching. These include using metadata tagging to detect unauthorized system access; utilizing context sensing pipelines to determine the intent of instructions; and employing formal methods to reason about integrated circuit systems and guarantee the accuracy of security characteristics.Throughout the life of the program, SSITH seeks to continuously evaluate and strengthen the secure hardware architectures in development. To support this evaluation, SSITH is developing software tools to quantitatively measure the security properties of the hardware architectures and to express and reason about security architectures at the abstract (model) level and the concrete (product) level. Further, SSITH is exploring external evaluation efforts that involve crowdsourced red teaming of the technologies in development. This included DARPA’s first ever bug bounty program, Finding Exploits to Thwart Tampering (FETT) Bug Bounty. Additional information on FETT is available here, https://fett.darpa.mil/To accomplish its goal, SSITH encourages collaboration between academic, commercial, and the defense industrial base to provide robust and flexible solutions applicable to both DoD and commercial electronic systems. SSITH has successfully developed a number of RISC-V FPGA-based technology demonstrations, and the technologies have been incorporated into commercial designs. The ultimate goal of the program is to produce SSITH ASICs with near-term applicability to a range of systems – from embedded systems found in mobile phones and IoT devices to high performance servers in the cloud and military systems. |/news-events/darpa-finding-exploits-to-thwart-tampering.html,DARPA Finding Exploits to Thwart Tampering (FETT) Bug Bounty Capture-the-Flag Qualifier;/news-events/ssith-proposers-day.html,System Security Integrated Through Hardware and Firmware (SSITH) Proposers Day;/news-events/2021-10-20.html,DARPA Moving SSITH Safeguards Closer to Practical Use;/news-events/2021-06-30a.html,DARPA Open Sources FETT Bug Bounty Hardware Evaluation Platform, Tools;/news-events/2021-03-08.html,DARPA Selects Researchers to Accelerate Use of Fully Homomorphic Encryption

The Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program is a joint DARPA/U.S. Air Force (USAF) effort that aims to develop and demonstrate technologies to enable future air-launched, tactical-range hypersonic boost glide systems. In a boost glide system, a rocket accelerates its payload to high speeds. The payload then separates from the rocket and glides unpowered to its destination. The TBG program plans to focus on three primary objectives:Vehicle Feasibility—Vehicle concepts possessing the required aerodynamic and aerothermal performance, controllability and robustness for a wide operational envelopeEffectiveness—System attributes and subsystems required to be effective in relevant operational environmentsAffordability—Approaches to reducing cost and increasing value for both the demonstration system and future operational systems TBG is a two-phase effort that plans to include ground and flight testing to mature critical technologies, and aims to demonstrate the system performance achievable through the integration of those technologies. The program is using a disciplined systems engineering approach to define demonstration system objectives and identify enabling technologies needed for future systems. The TBG program is exploiting the technical knowledge and lessons derived from development and flight testing of previous boost glide systems, including the Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2). |/news-events/advanced-full-range-engine.html,Advanced Full Range Engine;/news-events/proposers-day-announcement-for-ace.html,Air Combat Evolution (ACE) Proposers Day;/news-events/air-combat-evolution-technical-area-one-proposers-day.html,Air Combat Evolution (ACE) Technical Area 1 Proposers Day;/news-events/air-space-total-awareness-for-rapid-tactical-execution-proposers-day.html,Air Space Total Awareness for Rapid Tactical Execution (ASTARTE) Proposers Day;/news-events/control-of-revolutionary-aircraft-with-novel-effecters-proposers-day.html,Control of Revolutionary Aircraft with Novel Effecters (CRANE) Proposers Day

If successful, TNT technology would apply to a wide range of defense-relevant needs, including foreign language learning, marksmanship, cryptography, target discrimination, and intelligence analysis, improving outcomes while reducing the cost and duration of the Defense Department’s extensive training regimen.TNT focuses on a specific kind of learning—cognitive skills training. The premise is that during optimal times in the training process, precise activation of peripheral nerves through stimulation can boost the release of brain chemicals such as acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine that promote and strengthen neuronal connections in the brain. These so-called neuromodulators play a role in regulating synaptic plasticity, the process by which connections between neurons change to improve brain function during learning. By combining peripheral neurostimulation with conventional training practices, the TNT program seeks to leverage endogenous neural circuitry to enhance learning by facilitating tuning of the neural networks responsible for cognitive functions.DARPA is taking a layered approach to exploring this new terrain. Fundamental research focuses on gaining a clearer and more complete understanding of how nerve stimulation influences synaptic plasticity, how cognitive skill learning processes are regulated in the brain, and how to boost these processes to safely accelerate skill acquisition while avoiding potential side effects. The engineering side of the program concentrates on developing non-invasive methods to deliver peripheral nerve stimulation that enhances plasticity in brain regions responsible for cognitive functions. Human subjects research will help determine the extent to which peripheral nerve stimulation aids in key training activities. Additionally, key advances anticipated from this research will both create an anatomical and functional map of the underlying biological circuitry that mediates plasticity and optimize stimulation and training protocols to enable long-term retention of learned skills by military personnel.TNT is informed by independent Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) experts to help DARPA proactively identify potential issues related to the use of neurotechnology. Communications with ELSI experts supplement the standard oversight provided by institutional review boards that govern human clinical studies and animal use. |/news-events/2017-04-26.html,TNT Researchers Set Out to Advance Pace and Effectiveness of Cognitive Skills Training;/news-events/2016-03-16.html,Boosting Synaptic Plasticity to Accelerate Learning;/program/restoring-active-memory.html,Restoring Active Memory ;/news-events/measuring-biological-aptitude-proposers-day.html,Measuring Biological Aptitude (MBA) Proposers Day;/news-events/military-invention-day-at-the-smithsonian.html,Military Invention Day at the Smithsonian

Abe|/staff/dr-david-abe.html|EM Waves,Electromagnetic Waves,/tag-list.html?tag=EM Waves|The Waveform Agile Radio-frequency Directed ENergy (WARDEN) program seeks to develop hardware, theory, and computational models to extend the range and effectiveness of high-power microwave (HPM) systems for backdoor attacks. HPM systems are a class of directed energy weapons (DEWs) that use electromagnetic (EM) radiation to disrupt, disable, or damage targeted electronic components and circuits. Electromagnetic radiation can couple into targets in-band via intentional ports such as antennas (“front door”) or via unintentional coupling paths such as seams, apertures, and cable entry points (“back door”). The advantages of HPM systems include non-kinetic, wide-area effects at large stand-off distances; deep magazines; operation in adverse environmental conditions; and speed-of-light engagement. In general, current HPM systems use oscillators as their RF source. These systems operate at a fixed frequency, are not readily tunable, and lack the phase coherence necessary for power combining. Front-door systems have the longest range, but their effectiveness is limited to the specific classes of targets for which they were designed. Back-door systems are effective against a wider variety of targets, but their range is limited by EM coupling inefficiencies arising from their lack of frequency tunability. Agile waveforms, combined with broadband high-power amplifiers, can reduce the threshold of the susceptibility of targeted systems to backdoor attacks and significantly extend the range and effectiveness of the HPM weapon system. WARDEN is developing flexible HPM technology that can be useful against a wide variety of target types.The WARDEN program comprises three technical areas: HPM Traveling-wave Amplifier development, Rapid Assessment and Numerical Generation of EM Response (RANGER), and Agile Waveform Development. These key areas will be central in developing the necessary hardware, modeling tools and waveforms need to make WARDEN successful. |/news-events/advanced-concept-compact-electron-linear-accelerator-proposers-day.html,Advanced Concept Compact Electron Linear-accelerator (ACCEL) Proposers Day;/news-events/enabling-night-vision-in-eyeglass-form-factors-proposers-day.html,Enabling Night Vision in eyeglass form factors (ENVision) Proposers Day;/news-events/ouija-ta2-proposers-day.html,Ouija TA-2  Proposers day;/news-events/science-of-atomic-vapors-for-new-technologies-proposers-day.html,Science of Atomic Vapors for New Technologies (SAVaNT) Proposers Day;/news-events/2023-01-23.html,Liquid-Mirror Program to Revolutionize Telescope Designs

The use of a monolithic three-dimensional system-on-chip (SoC) stack to integrate memory and logic is one approach that could dramatically alter the memory bottleneck challenge. However, developing an effective 3D SoC stack would require increasing the width of buses to memory through much finer pitch interconnects, while simultaneously decreasing the resistor-capacitor (RC) delays through much shorter interconnect lines in the SoC To address the memory bottleneck problem, the Three Dimensional Monolithic System-on-a-Chip (3DSoC) program seeks to develop the monolithic 3D technology required to build logic, memory, and input/output (I/O) on a single die using a legacy lithography node while improving performance by more than 50X when compared with leading edge technology nodes. To achieve its goals, 3DSoC seeks to develop fabrication technology as well as the design flows required to take advantage of the technology’s capabilities. The 3DSoC program aims to drive the future of computation architecture, removing the limitations of the current 2D approach to SoC design and manufacturing.  The resulting fabrication technology is intended to be based at a U.S. manufacturing facility, which will allow Department of Defense (DoD) entities to have easy access to the technology, tools, and manufacturing capabilities to explore and build future computation systems that will deliver 50X better performance at power results and improve the performance of future DoD systems.  |/news-events/electronics-resurgence-initiative-summit.html,Electronics Resurgence Initiative Summit;/news-events/2021-12-22.html,DARPA Joins Public-Private Partnership to Address Challenges Facing Microelectronics Advancement;/news-events/2020-06-17.html,DARPA Announces Third-Annual Electronics Resurgence Initiative Summit & MTO Symposium;/news-events/2019-05-31.html,DARPA Announces ERI Summit 2019 Workshops;/news-events/2019-04-05.html,DARPA Announces Second Annual ERI Summit

Active gain through traveling wave interaction has been observed or postulated in other domains but has yet to be widely exploited.The benefits of coupled wave interaction are not limited to THz electronics. Acoustoelectric amplification was first demonstrated in the 1960s. Since then, new piezoelectric materials, device architectures, and fabrication techniques present opportunities to create surface acoustic wave devices with active gain, with advantages ranging from reduced insertion loss to net-positive signal amplification. Spin waves have found application in devices such as frequency selective limiters, phase shifters, delay lines, etc. and more recently are under consideration for nanoscale transmission and processing of information. New techniques using phenomena such as spin-transfer torque and spin-orbit torque show promise to produce spin wave amplification to overcome conversion and propagation losses.The Traveling-Wave Energy Enhancement Devices (TWEED) Microsystems Exploration (µE) topic aims to develop and demonstrate new approaches using coupled- or traveling-wave interaction to achieve active gain in sub-THz/THz, acoustoelectric, or spin wave devices. The goal of TWEED is to demonstrate proof-of-concept devices that establish the viability of novel approaches that can lead to revolutionary advances in areas such as THz electronics, signal processing, and magnonics. Further, to support potential transitions, the µE emphasizes device architectures and materials that are compatible with current commercial fabrication processes. |/news-events/electronics-resurgence-initiative-summit.html,Electronics Resurgence Initiative Summit;/news-events/enabling-night-vision-in-eyeglass-form-factors-proposers-day.html,Enabling Night Vision in eyeglass form factors (ENVision) Proposers Day;/news-events/2021-12-22.html,DARPA Joins Public-Private Partnership to Address Challenges Facing Microelectronics Advancement;/news-events/2020-06-17.html,DARPA Announces Third-Annual Electronics Resurgence Initiative Summit & MTO Symposium;/news-events/2019-05-31.html,DARPA Announces ERI Summit 2019 Workshops
Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing (US2QC) |It has been credibly hypothesized &ndash; but not proven &ndash; that quantum computers will have a transformative impact on a variety of scientific and technical disciplines. Two separate factors make the ultimate impact of quantum computing unclear. First, although a number of algorithms and applications for quantum computers have been suggested, in most cases a rigorous comparison to the best classical alternatives for real-world usage has not been completed. Second, it is unclear when or if a &ldquo;utility-scale&rdquo; quantum computer &ndash; one whose computational value exceeds its costs &ndash; can be built, particularly for applications that require fault-tolerance. |https://www.darpa.mil/JSON/program/underexplored-systems-for-utility-scale-quantum-computing.json|MTO|Dr. Joe Altepeter|/staff/dr-joe-altepeter.html|Alternative Computing,Alternative Computing,/tag-list.html?tag=Alternative Computing;Quantum,Quantum Science,/tag-list.html?tag=Quantum|It has been credibly hypothesized – but not proven – that quantum computers will have a transformative impact on a variety of scientific and technical disciplines. Two separate factors make the ultimate impact of quantum computing unclear. First, although a number of algorithms and applications for quantum computers have been suggested, in most cases a rigorous comparison to the best classical alternatives for real-world usage has not been completed. Second, it is unclear when or if a “utility-scale” quantum computer – one whose computational value exceeds its costs – can be built, particularly for applications that require fault-tolerance. The complexity of a fault-tolerant utility-scale quantum computer could approach or exceed that of a classical supercomputer. A verification and validation effort that demonstrates a utility-scale design is viable, all necessary components and sub-systems for the computer can be produced at the required specifications, and all components and sub-systems can be successfully integrated would likely be a difficult, multi-year process. The primary goal of the US2QC program is to determine if an underexplored approach to quantum computing is capable of achieving utility-scale operation much faster than conventional predictions. US2QC will accomplish this goal through rigorous, collaborative, flexible verification and validation performed in parallel with on-going research and development efforts. |/news-events/impaqt-webinar,Imagining Practical Applications for a Quantum Tomorrow (IMPAQT) Webinar;/news-events/quantum-benchmarking-proposers-day,Quantum Benchmarking Proposers Day;/news-events/2023-08-18,Voices from DARPA Episode 71: The Quantum Mechanic;/news-events/2023-03-07,DARPA Seeks Input to Advance Hybrid Quantum/Classical Computers;/news-events/2023-01-31a,DARPA Collaborates with Commercial Partners to Accelerate Quantum Computing
Urban Reconnaissance through Supervised Autonomy  (URSA) |Urban Reconnaissance through Supervised Autonomy (URSA) is a DARPA program to enable improved techniques for rapidly discriminating hostile intent and filtering out threats in complex urban environments.|https://www.darpa.mil/JSON/program/urban-reconnaissance-through-supervised-autonomy.json|TTO|Dr. Bartlett Russell|/staff/dr-bartlett-russell.html|Analytics,Analytics for Data at Massive Scales,/tag-list.html?tag=Analytics;Autonomy,Supervised Autonomy,/tag-list.html?tag=Autonomy;Cognitive Science,Cognitive Science,/tag-list.html?tag=Cognitive Science;Complexity,Harnessing Complexity,/tag-list.html?tag=Complexity;Ground,Ground Systems,/tag-list.html?tag=Ground|Urban Reconnaissance through Supervised Autonomy (URSA) is a DARPA program to enable improved techniques for rapidly discriminating hostile intent and filtering out threats in complex urban environments. Reconnaissance, surveillance, and target identification within urban terrain is a vexing problem for the U.S. military. Urban spaces can mask threats as they move and obscure threats as they approach. Additionally, the urban environment includes civilians who must be protected. Currently, U.S. forces must rely on dismounted warfighters to actively patrol urban areas to ferret out threats and maintain safety and security, a manpower and time intensive exercise that exposes those warfighters to significant risk.  The URSA vision is to develop technology to enable autonomous systems that U.S. ground forces supervise and operate to detect hostile forces and establish positive identification before any U.S. troops come in contact with them. The URSA program seeks to overcome the complexity of the urban environment by combining new knowledge about human behaviors, autonomy algorithms, integrated sensors, multiple sensor modalities, and measurable human responses to discriminate the subtle differences between hostile and innocent people. As they do today, humans will make the final decision on whether to escalate or reduce response to a perceived threat. Those decisions, however, will benefit from additional intelligence from URSA prior to direct engagement.    |/news-events/ursa-proposers-day.html,URSA Proposers Day;/news-events/enhancing-design-through-graceful-extensibility-proposers-day.html,Enhancing Design through Graceful Extensibility (EDGE) Proposers Day;/news-events/2021-05-21.html,Enabling Human Control of Autonomous Partners;/news-events/2017-09-07.html,Young Faculty Award 2018 Research Topics Announced;/news-events/2017-05-31.html,Teaching Robots “Manners”: Digitally Capturing and Conveying Human Norms 
Verified Security and Performance Enhancement of Large Legacy Software (V-SPELLS) |The DoD has a critical need for enhancing and replacing components of existing software with more secure and more performant code. This includes cases where a key performance or security benefit comes from moving parts of the software to new hardware, such as utilizing hardware accelerators, isolation enclaves, offload processors, and distributed computation.|https://www.darpa.mil/JSON/program/verified-security-and-performance-enhancement-of-large-legacy-software.json|I2O|Dr. Sergey Bratus|/staff/dr-sergey-bratus.html|Cyber,Cyber,/tag-list.html?tag=Cyber;Systems,Systems of Systems,/tag-list.html?tag=Systems|The DoD has a critical need for enhancing and replacing components of existing software with more secure and more performant code. This includes cases where a key performance or security benefit comes from moving parts of the software to new hardware, such as utilizing hardware accelerators, isolation enclaves, offload processors, and distributed computation. However, introducing enhancements or replacements into large legacy code bases carries a high risk that new code will not safely compose with the rest of the system. Verified programming methodologies for creating software that is correct-by-construction are currently not effective for lowering this risk, because they focus on clean-slate software construction, assume an existing formal specification that is typically not available for a legacy system, and require formal methods expertise typically not accessible to developers.The goal of the V-SPELLS program is to create a developer-accessible capability for piece-by-piece enhancement of software components with new verified code that is both correct-by-construction and compatible-by-construction, i.e., safely composable with the rest of the system. V-SPELLS will create practical tools for developers to gain benefits of formal software verification in incremental software (re)engineering rather than only in clean-slate introduction. V-SPELLS tools will enable developers to deliver assured incremental modernization of legacy systems in a manner that leverages verification technologies and reduces rather than raises risk. V-SPELLS aims to radically broaden adoption of software verification by enabling incremental introduction of superior technologies into systems that cannot be re-designed from scratch and replaced as a whole.To accomplish these goals, the V-SPELLS program will leverage a combination of novel concepts in program understanding and verification, as well as recent developments in domain specific languages and composable system architectures for production systems at scale. The program seeks breakthroughs in and novel approaches to the following technical challenges, including, but not limited to:Automated program understanding to infer architectural structure, assumptions, and dependencies in a legacy source code base, enabling its decomposition into components with explicit modular structure, interfaces, dependencies, and constraints. Recovery of domain abstractions and models from legacy code bases, in succinct and expressive representations suitable for programming functional component enhancements or replacements that are safely composable with the existing systems.Matching known and extracted domain abstractions and models with legacy code, lifting of legacy code to succinct, enhanceable, safely composable, and inter-operating representations, and automated specification inference leveraging such representation. Provably safe composition of enhancements with the rest of the system.Overcoming performance reduction due to added layers of abstraction with novel verified cross-layer optimization and distribution techniques (“verified stack flattening and distribution”). Development of non-brittle and granular rules for composable representation, packaging, and transformation of software verification proofs that support distribution and orchestration of verified programs.The V-SPELLS BAA is available here.|/news-events/hardening-development-toolchains-against-emergent-execution-engines-proposers-day.html,Hardening Development Toolchains Against Emergent Execution Engines (HARDEN) Proposers Day;/news-events/2022-10-13.html,DARPA Selects Teams to Protect Computers’ ‘Roots of Trust’ from Exploits;/news-events/2021-09-22.html,Disrupting Exploitable Patterns in Software to Make Systems Safer;/news-events/2021-04-22.html,Researchers Demonstrate Potential for Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Vulnerability Disclosure;/news-events/2019-07-18.html,Generating Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Defense Capabilities
Warfighter Analytics using Smartphones for Health (WASH) |Currently, understanding and assessing the readiness of the warfighter involves medical intervention with the help of advanced equipment, such as electrocardiographs (EKGs) and other specialized medical devices, that are too expensive and cumbersome to employ continuously or without supervision in non-controlled environments.

On the other hand, currently 92 percent of adults in the United States own a cell phone, which could be used as the basis for continuous, passive health, and readiness assessment.  The Warfighter Analytics using Smartphones for Health (WASH) program seeks to use data collected from cellphone sensors to enable novel algorithms that conduct passive, continuous, real-time assessment of the warfighter. The objective of WASH is to extract physiological signals, which may be weak and noisy, that are embedded in the data obtained through existing mobile device sensors (e.g., accelerometer, screen, microphone). Such extraction and analysis, done on a continuous basis, may help determine current health status and identify latent or developing health disorders (Figure 1).  Figure 1: WASH health determination WASH research will explore the development of algorithms and techniques for identifying both known indicators of physiological problems (such as disease, illness, and/or injury) and deviations from the warfighter’s micro-behaviors that could indicate such problems. It is also expected that additional “digital biomarkers” of physiological problems may be identified during the research through the combination of big data analytics and medical ground truth provided to performers. Digital biomarkers are consumer-generated physiological and behavioral measures collected through connected digital tools, in this case a smartphone. A prerequisite for the extraction and interpretation of the raw sensor data and any identified digital biomarkers is determining the context of such data collection and analysis, which may affect the relevance of any given sensor and  permit “denoising,” or elimination of irrelevant or misleading readings. For example, relying on cellphone accelerometer data while the warfighter is in a moving vehicle would likely negatively influence the utility of such data for WASH-type analysis unless the auxiliary motion is identified and cancelled. Thus, key focus areas will be the extraction of the signal context and the identification of complicated actions and environmental variables, and the association of user state with symptoms of illness conditions in order to identify potential illnesses and conditions before conventional symptomatic display. It is the union of personal behavior/characteristics, smartphone sensor collection, context of smartphone use, and disease biomarkers that will define the preclinical health determination of the WASH program (Figure 2).  Figure 2: WASH program concept The program goal is to enable the creation of a mobile application that passively assesses a warfighter’s readiness immediately and over time. This application seeks to provide:  Clinicians with plausible health conditions supported by the analysis, determination, and fusion of digital biomarkers for disease correlation against ground truth;  Commanders with unit readiness information, both at the current time and in the near future; and Users of the device with information about their current health status and early indicators of medical conditions.   |/news-events/hierarchical-identify-verify-exploit-proposers-day.html,Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) Proposers Day;/news-events/knowledge-management-at-scale-and-speed-proposers-day.html,Knowledge Management at Scale and Speed (KMASS) Proposers Day;/news-events/2022-09-23.html,DARPA Selects Teams to Improve How Scientists Build/Sustain Models, Simulations ;/news-events/2021-06-21.html,Ensuring Continuity of Knowledge During Unit Rotations, Individual Replacements;/news-events/2019-01-04.html,Generating Actionable Understanding of Real-World Phenomena with AI

The goal is to develop approaches that can accommodate and integrate dozens of contributing models connected by thousands of pathways—orders of magnitude beyond what is possible today. World Modelers analyses are intended to be timely enough to recommend specific actions that could avert crises. The program seeks to develop technologies that will provide clearly parameterized, quantitative projections within weeks or even hours of processing, compared to the months or years it takes today to understand considerably simpler systems. World Modelers technologies will be applied to increasingly varied use cases as they mature through the phases of the program. Questions for analysis will typically be framed at subnational scales and look one to five years into the future, although the factors that influence outcomes of interest might operate on larger spatial and temporal scales. This subnational focus reflects the changing nature of conflict and security, which, increasingly, plays out in cities and districts. The first use case of World Modelers is food insecurity resulting from the interactions of multiple factors, including climate, water availability, soil viability, market instability, and physical security. |/news-events/accelerated-molecular-discovery.html,Accelerated Molecular Discovery;/news-events/knowlege-directed-artificial-intelligence-reasoning-over-schemas-proposers-day.html,Knowledge-directed Artificial Intelligence Reasoning Over Schemas (KAIROS) Proposers Day;/news-events/2018-10-04.html,Discovering New Molecules for Military Applications ;/news-events/2014-02-20.html,Big Mechanism Seeks the “Whys” Hidden in Big Data;/program/accelerated-molecular-discovery.html,Accelerated Molecular Discovery 
Zenith|The goal of Zenith is to design, build and test methods by which a telescope, comprising a reflective liquid primary surface held in a light-focusing shape, may be compelled to maintain that shape even if tilted out-of-plane. These mirrors will be tiltable, scalable, damage-resilient, suitable for both space and ground telescope applications, and in monolithic and segmented designs that require no motion to operate.  |https://www.darpa.mil/JSON/program/zenith.json|DSO|Maj Michael Nayak|/staff/maj-michael-nayak.html||The goal of Zenith is to design, build and test methods by which a telescope, comprising a reflective liquid primary surface held in a light-focusing shape, may be compelled to maintain that shape even if tilted out-of-plane. These mirrors will be tiltable, scalable, damage-resilient, suitable for both space and ground telescope applications, and in monolithic and segmented designs that require no motion to operate. The cost to build complex optics large enough to effectively resolve objects in geostationary orbit is prohibitive. Another key limitation for space-based telescopes is the escalating probability of in-orbit debris causing damage to solid lenses that cannot be repaired. Liquid mirror telescopes (LMTs) may be one way to enable next-generation, very large telescopes for vastly improved space domain awareness from the ground and in space. However, today’s ground-based LMTs are zenith restricted; the delicate force balance needed to mathematically guarantee a light-focusing shape requires the rotation axis be exactly vertical. Zenith aims to leverage recent advances in materials technology, electromagnetic force control, and other innovative methods to solve this restriction, and thereby create a new generation of LMTs that can enable a wide variety of astronomy applications.Zenith will break the paradigm of existing LMTs by imposing a key restriction: no motion to create or sustain the liquid optic surface. This will enable future space-based LMT concepts to be fielded without the additional complexity of spacecraft spin and thrust during imaging. The final phase of the program will also modify monolithic designs to include liquid mirror segmentation, and demonstrate end-to-end imaging capability with in-sky experimentation for both segmented and monolithic liquid mirrors. |
